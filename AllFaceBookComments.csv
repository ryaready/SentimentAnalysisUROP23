Yes definitely benefiting temasek holdings when they monopolize some of the markets like telcos is a good example. The foreigners need to use all these services which bring in profits for temasek. And when they lose in overseas investments they will increase the price of all these services. Businesses in shopping centres will benefit also when there’s more foreigners to spend but ultimate winner will be temasek holding also since the rentals will be high in the shopping centres which most of them temasek have shares in them,18,en

Mr Lee we know u care for Singapore but hopefully it is not NATO. We also know foreign talents and professionals are needed. This we will not fault u nor ur party. The issue is there is just too many companies that has an overdoses of foreign workers.

Same also for a construction company that only has a local as sales director with the rest from Malaysia and also for a finance company where all the staff are Caucasians. Maybe u can enlighten us how is this so? The important issue is to address the problem. Not pass it to us. We cannot do much.

The problem is more jobs lose in the coming months as countries fixing up their economic .This will result in not enough PMET jobs for both PR .EP. S and citizens. The solution is to off load EP .S.and WP holders temporary until the economic recover. Relocate our local workers left vacant from those foreigners. Companies usually promote their WP to supervision jobs. Why??? The jobs knowledge is on their fingers tip. Companies usually get Foreigners is their wages is cheap. They does not mind . Why ??? After work for 10 years is equal to 30 years in their own country. Bring in only those who can impart skill or bring in jobs or Rich. Any jobs that Singaporean and PR can do .Let them have it first.  Singaporean and PR must be willing to take on whatever jobs that interest them. Cut down on Govt spending .Come to worse .Wage cut on all Govt and Govt link companies. Add a social tax on all foreigners. If every foreigners pay ave $50 . 1.5 million is 75 million . This can be use as social cost. Have to transform the economic to knowledge digital economic.

Agreed that foreigners who help or contribute Singapore is greatly welcome . Who don’t welcome a good friend . The problem is when this people after some time take things for granted and make other people home like theirs and did not show gratitude but made a mess in the social level. The question here is who don’t not welcome good friend coming to your house everyone likes but the issue if this friends get out of hand then definitely the owner will think otherwise. I hope things can be control and red flags need not be raise as mentioned. Sometimes penny wise pound foolish situation. Although we can never be similar to country like Bhutan but can learn a little from them . Too materialistic on wealth and lost of identity sometimes can be trouble in the long run despite money is very crucial.,5,en

I have no doubt the Government will always be on the side of Singaporeans.The foreign talent policy in the past was meant to create greater opportunities for local employment growth. I agree it’s a good policy for a small nation like a Singspore. The only “problem” was that the authority have failed to manage the disproportionate increase in foreign PMET in certain sectors and from certain country. It also failed to ensure apparent discriminatory hiring process by some companies and to ensure transfer of skills and experience to our local PMET.,17,en

When there is no regulation over numbers, every Tom Dick Harry is coming, not just talents..

It is known that Singapore has always drives its people to be the best and top of anything; at anytime, anywhere.

"In 2009, I had the most shocking experience of this citizenship issue.  A colleague had joined a construction project site.  Within a short while, he was transferred to another department in the head office.  We weren't quite sure of his background but he was Indian and the company was owned by an India company.  He is sleeping by 9am (Yes, 9am in the morning) and snoring out loud in front of everybody everday.  Good thing for him, the office is in 2 buildings side by side and senior management is situated in the next building.  Soon after, he and his family (wife and 2 young kids) were conferred Singapore citizenship.  He continues to sleep by 9am every workday.  At one point, he falls very far behind in his work (which is of no quality) and said he would be coming in on Saturday to work (five day week).  On Monday, the section Assistant VP was jokingly telling the admin assistant (VERY LOUDLY) to order a bed and pillow.  He continued in the company but was not confirmed of his probation.  He was, subsequently, confirmed after 9 months.  On one instance, he was on his own in handling a tender and was working with a project team to prepare a tender.   The next thing I hear is HR wanted to see him.   He was terminated.  I heard that he was terminated by the one who originally hired him and that VP was on that site team.  Sad story for Singapore coz he already got his citizenship.",3,en

The Standard Chartered Bank has set up operating branches/offices in any city of India and in Singapore. It allows the employment to take place in India and then doing an intra-transfer.   In this case, it can and allow to bypass the necessary scrutiny by the SG relevant authorities. This is the potential loophole of the CECA.   Further, in the CECA agreement, there will be no cap of quotas for the intra-transfer of employee.",0,en
"Firstly, the Ministry of Manpower needs to find out exactly the underlying bottlenecks or problems from those employers either multi-national corporations or local big companies who prefer to employ foreign PMETs instead of the locals:  1.

What evidences to substantiate their claims- any interview profiles or records to prove that concerted efforts be deployed in hiring local PMETs?  3. The exact number of this category required for the specific company?  4. After all the above steps duly done, MOM needs to do a detailed postmortem to find pragmatic solutions.",0,en

"Dani Ash Alia Yes, in the 11th century, emissaries from the southern Chola empire came to Malaya(Malaysia and Singapore) to trade who are mostly hunters and fishermen.  They taught the Malays their way of life, including silmabattam, which became Silat as their martial art.  They called the locals Malayans which mean Hill ppl, since they are many hills here. The Malay language also compermised of the orang asli, Tamil and Sanskirt words (Tamil and Sanskirt has many similar words) Even the  Singapore stone's cravings was said anicent Tamil.  Yes you are right the wedding Dias too. Tamils have a tradition to include the banana tree in their wedding Dias and the Malays still follow a similar type of wedding Dias closely related to the Tamils style of wedding.

"Colette Lim a very simple answer on why foreigners can make money here. Coz foreigners will undercut locals in prices. Foreigners are CHEAP. That's why.  And in MNC, if HR is a foreigner, he will bring his whole village. V simple, recently, a friend of mine was selected for the job, HR told him that he has been selected n  to wait for him to process. After a few days, no news from HR. Luckily, the manager who interviewed him called my friend  to ask why he changed his mind. - that was when he realised what the Indian HR did.  V few managers will bother to call if HR tells them the applicant rejected the job. Fortunately, my friend has very good credentials. When my friend called up the HR manager, he conveniently said he forgot.   Hence, it has absolutely NOTHING to do with their IQ but everything to do with how UNSCRUPULOUS these foreigners are.  Sg overall WHOLE population has HIGHEST IQ in the world. We don't need your pathetic analysis of 10% or 1%.

How everything and every policy was to protect the singaporean identity and core first and foremost. If the CECA was handled by our past leaders , it would have been totally different from what we have today.  Honestly,  CECA would have been fine if it was finely calibrated and instead of allowing recruitment of professionals  from all over india bringing many candidates who do not speak Tamil , they could have given priority to professionals from the southern state of Tamil Nadu which has a Long shared history with the people of Singapore especially singaporean Indians . At least , the assimilation would have been a lot easier.   But those who are involved in this whole agreement , never even consider that and just blindly opened the floodgates. It’s common sense that you would have thought people in those high positions would have taken into consideration all these important  details . The cultural sensitivities , the existing Tamil singaporean Indian population and its effect if suddenly there is a huge non Tamil speaking diaspora of Indian immmigrants/professionals. I think our Govt officials of the past were very wary of all those details  . Dunno what went wrong now until so much negative backlash for CECA. What went wrong ?

Even if we go by ur assumption that India has only quantity and lack quality, do note that just 1% of their current growing population is about 4x that of SG citizens and 2x that of the total SG population (and this is assuming everyone is SG has the qualities u desire of from Indians)",2,en

"Dear Government of Singapore, I was retrenched in January 2021 together with other Singaporeans and a PR. The Malaysians, Indians and Pinoys remained. Looking back, the foreign talent did not add their ‘country knowledge’ or ‘country talent’ nor ‘country connections’ to the local company. It took our own local team to bring in business from Asia - not the foreigners. And yet, they (we) were retrenched.  Of course, I am sure there are many foreign talents who do add much value to Sg and their companies and my experience may be unique. I see many able bodied Singaporeans becoming drivers, food delivery and e-commerce last mile delivery people. It is increasingly frustrating not to be able to land a well paying job when we have taken all the courses and certification. If you can take a step back and stop telling Singaporeans about the ills of being xenophobic (because we are not and we welcome diversity) - the underlying message that is critical and not addressed is that we expect our own Singapore government to do more and ensure we provide local Singaporeans the 1 st priority to white collar jobs. I think this is critical in grooming our next generation of business leaders in Singapore. If we do not ensure our own have the chance to lead major institutions and businesses- we risk loosing the exposure and experience, which will be lost when our foreign friends leave for better offers in other countries. It is also a matter of long term national stability and security to have our own citizens helming leadership positions so that they have the long term interest of our own country. Please don’t think of Singaporeans as being short sighted or xenophobic. I am proud to be a Singaporean built by a foundation of multiculturalism - Malays, Indians, Chinese and Eurasians who now call Singapore home. We do not hate any particular race, instead we celebrate our diversity in so many ways and also laugh at our own peculiar habits. I am certain many Singaporeans would like transparency (which was withheld) and a plan forward to ensure citizens feel secure and cared for by our elected government. Thank you.",27,en

This is how we are to compete on the world stage and at least come close with other major hubs such as New York and London which are themselves even more globalized than us. This competition will undoubtedly increase in a post-pandemic world. Any policy that attempts to dismantle rather than build upon this is simply taking Singapore two or more steps back.

And even so, it's was so strict to the extent their local companies had 99.8% hard time of justifying to let the foreigners to fill in the job application. It's like mission impossible. Opposite of Singapore.   Please kindly take note we have the BEST education system and BEST and huge percentage of well education work force why can't they get a job or a really good pay job and why a lot of them including graduates have to become Grab drivers or deliverymen and be distancing ambassadors or even other lower pay jobs when expats are highly paid with all perks.  Are their high pay jobs really can't be filled by the local graduates and highly educated local??? It's really like telling bs. We have the best education system and the best and highest percentage of overall well educated local workforce. We are more concern about higher job position White collars jobs not those blue collar jobs that the govt is stressing.   Our Singapore leaders have to take note the main thing why this is raised up over past fifteen years or more is because it's totally overlooked by the leaders and closed two eyes even until now.   And now the Pandemic had worsen the situation to extreme. People are angry and upset now for real reason.   The right way as a leader to do now is not to shift their responsibilities and  stop using globalisation as a excuse. And rectify  it in the right way.    Germany is also under going globalisation. Not just Singapore and other countries.   It is a matter how strong our Singapore law is protecting our local citizens and make sure they have the good safety net of not losing their jobs no matter what and get a good pay.    Others are all lame  excuses in the eyes of local citizens. It's how you play this chess game of globalisation. If any good leaders recognise the fact that they had did a mistake they should admit openly and stop saying they are doing a good job when everyone is struggling and fear of losing jobs at anytime or even worst totally have no jobs. Any good leader should implement a strong law to protect the local not to lose their jobs to foreigners at any circumstances unless special situation. If they need a reference, check the Germany law how they protect their local from losing jobs.   Germans don't worry to lose their jobs. The Germans  have a safety net of retirement as well. Their worries is only how to spend their next holiday on summer and winter. Unlike local Singaporeans, worry how to get good pay job or Job to feed the family.  Imagine a local minister lost his job to the foreign minister in a blink. How will he felt?? And couldn't find another minister job and plus addition clause that he cannot sitting as director in any corporation to get any dividend or extra income.

"Avid Loh it a YES and No to your reply also. How many will think that a degree holder become food delivery, who drive PHV? The job is not much of an issue but it the way the culture changed. Food delivery man can earn more than a fresh grab in a white shirt but with no CPF and medical coverage but yet the take home can be much more than what a PMET is earning. If you will to pay $5k for a cleaners do u still hear the parent tell the kids the same story? In Australia, there are some jobs just offer to the local and monthly take home around $5k aus this is same as some other countries you mention. Go look into the pay system before we really talk about this, the reason why many parent don't want the kids to sweep the street mainly due to the pay. How can u survive with $1200 below after u spend so much money into study, so what is the real issue? The teaching is wrong so do we want those wrong teaching to continue? Do we want to encourage. Or do we want a change to move singapore to the next stage. Have anyone think why we have so many Philippines nurse than local? Is it becos no one want to take the offer? Look at the swabber how many people go into the line due to pay. If u study in to degree and pay is below $1000 or when u go interview and keep being reject, what is the next job u can pick up. I will go for a food rider than a cleaner as it give me more earning to survive. So end of the day it still go to the earning. Do u agree",0,en

Whenever there's talk about certain jobs it always shift towards a degree holder won't do that. Well of cuz they won't! Because I'm not talking about them.  And its merely my observation that it is what it is over here. And  it extends to not just about pay. Its also about face.  How can you survive with a 1200 is a great question. Hence government is only now trying to up the min wage.  There are many reason for example why so many Philippinoes choose to work here. It's safe, our exchange rate and over at Philippines, so many people compete for jobs that after a certain age you can't find certain jobs anymore  and that happens to many other countries as well.   Yes a food delivery guy could earn more than a white collar but at what cost? You mention they do not have certain benefits which if you have read my previous reply, I already acknowledge with the question of why are they not made more appealing?  Honestly, all those points that you made is the problems certain jobs are shunned. My biggest question is why? Why not do more to raise the benefits of such jobs?

K Shanmugam Sc has resorted to turning a valid concern into something political to distract and avoid the issue. This kind of disgraceful behaviour has turned Parliament into a theater.  Singaporeans can't be fooled and can see the real motives behind his line of questioning, trying to discredit and frame critics, to provide content for mainstream media to demonised them, so that everyone forgets about the real issue on hand.  Lawrence Wong has also shown his true colours and ignorance. Using stories to suit his political narratives without even trying to understand what the real issue is.  Local indians might have a higher chance of getting their resume filtered, and this is largely due to the mountain of resumes sent in by foreign indians, even though they are not eligible.

" We have to see the debate in perspective and be objective to see if Singaporeans’ interests are served well for short term and most importantly long term.   1/ Pandemic has disrupted many industries Globally in particular aviation, tourism, hospitality, F&B and other services where large % of locals are employed. Singapore is even more impacted on these sectors as we have no domestic market or domestic tourism unlike China, India, and the US. China’s domestic tourism is now at the pre-pandemic level. So are India and the US.   2/ Global and Regional companies set up operations in Singapore not to serve Singapore market which is tiny for them but to serve the region and the world. Singaporeans who are plugged into their regional and Global aspirations will do well and have been doing well. This means developing leadership qualities and new skills to serve external market. Singaporeans should focus on this as this the vital gap that exists. Top quality education as it exists in Singapore that does not prepare Singaporeans well for complexity and Chaos, but it provides theoretical expertise and knowledge. Rising in the corporate world requires ability to navigate the region and if it means working outside of Singapore for a while. The quality to understand complexity and chaos come naturally to those who come from bigger markets – US, Europe, India, China, Philippines, etc. Point is we should serve the region in our employment role and not get stuck in serving small markets if one must rise and progress.  3/ Pandemic has accelerated digitalization exponentially. And the skills required are very different and the demand is very high. Singapore Universities and Polys, though rated very well, cannot meet the demand. We can increase by 20% but it is still not enough. Singapore cannot afford to restrict talents in this IT and other engineering sectors. If we do, companies will move out and IT jobs can be done from anywhere now. Even in India, there is tremendous shortage of IT talents, and you have to Google to see the offers IT graduates are getting. First choice of Indian IT talent is US, Canada, and Europe not Singapore. We must fight hard to get these talents. Talk to IT companies and you will know. That is why we have so many unfilled IT positions.   4/ Can we substantially increase student intakes and train in IT from very early days? Yes, but it is not going to help meet the demand. Writing code is not a rising career and learning them will not help as a person can get stuck. But Exposure early stages will help to appreciate, and that knowledge will help. Most important is to realize that we don’t have adequate population base to keep supplying to meet the demand. Not all students have aptitude for engineering and Information technology. We cannot force. This is where India has an advantage. Millions study IT every year and discount the schools that are not good enough, but India will still produce few hundred thousand IT engineers every year. And close to 170K go to US every year as the demand is very high for this talent in the US and other countries in the West. Stop whining and accept the realities. The reality could be to shut the door to IT industries and the companies who need IT talents, but we will all suffer. We will lose regional investment and dislocation of those who are already here. Always remember Global and regional companies are not in Singapore to serve local market but to serve the region.  5/ Xenophobia and racism are mental disease. You can’t get agitated by seeing expats (Indians) and assume that they are all through CECA. Indians have been in senior position in Global and Regional companies for a very long period. Not all are in IT industries. Many are in leadership positions and brough here by their companies who have made huge investment. Around 20 Global CEO of tech companies and non-tech companies are Indians born and bred in India.   6/ Singaporeans must shed this parochial outlook and start behaving like a Global Citizen. We have the education and qualities, but xenophobia and racism will pull us back. We learn to embrace diversity and enjoy working with multiple cultures. Joy and learning are different.   Needless to highlight that we should have stricter policies, guidelines, and rules to weed out abuses that impact Singaporeans. But that is work in progress as the minister says. Understand the macro picture and let’s work out micro actions required. Let’s not push the country backward and collectively lower our living standards. ",0,en

If all the CECA are working under local pmet and no local pmet are displaced, who will complain. Have u see we complain about foreign construction workers in Singapore?   I dont read foreign articles, i use my eyes and ears to judge by myself before i say them. I see so many useless FT and so many senior pmet being retrenched. So don’t pretend things don’t happen just because the gov choose not to report them.  Demand cpf is normal since it is promised by the 1st gen government that the money that use to develop the country together with be returned when the contributor reach 55. Then the government start to change their words and say people cannot control their money for retirement and hence lock up the cpf. So nothing wrong for people to demand their own money back.   I hope u know what you are talking about when you speak about the government provide upgrade. There are alot of them are irrelevant and basically asking people to learn something else and accept a lower income. But considering some of them committed with an expensive hdb or condo and still have to support children and parents, then lost his current job, how he is able to accept a pay that cut more than 70%. Although i do not agree that they just wait for miracles, they should just do whatever come to them and search for a better one later. But i pity those that lost their job with thousands of debt to paid up monthly. So you can’t blame them for being angry.  When a thousand people see one foreigner earning high salary, we  admire him. When ten people see a foreigner earn high salary, we respect him. But when you see the foreigner taking away the job at a lower price and local get disposed, people get angry. Remember they are foreigner and their homelands is not Singapore, the salary they make here is few time higher in their home. They struggle here for 5 years or so, they can afford a landed property back home. But for those local that lower their salary to compete, they have no where to retreat. So please, every leader have to think about your own people that build this nation together. When crisis occurred, the local have to stay to defend this land while the foreigner will evacuate back to their home town. If the local cannot do the job, make them do it and not getting foreigner to fill up the role.  This is like a country that depend on foreign soldier to defend them. In peace time, they enjoy their time and earn their money, if they think they cannot win, they will leave and the local will suffer. That is why we build our own military.

"Simon Chen dude the Malaysian Chinese in PMET positions have highly likely converted to SC/PR. Do you even know what you’re saying? It is not manufacturing or retail/F&B we are talking about here. Why would any hiring manager hire and keep employed an underperforming staff to affect their KPIs and bonus?   Reading TOC and accepting wholesale what Lim Tean or even PSP is saying IS referring to foreign sponsored media agencies. I’m sure there are people displaced, but the comments I read are rarely of first-hand or first person information with actual examples. If you had actual examples, wouldn’t those people take it to the relevant ministry and seek redress?  Demand CPF is NOT normal when the intent of the use of the money is not for actual survival, but to pursue material luxuries, pay existing self-incurred debts. Indeed, it is precisely because of this, that your cpf is given out to you in tranches to ENSURE you do not blow it out all at one go. Also, if you maximise your 2 BTO chances and downgrade at the 3rd purchase, a person with average income will hit all the required amounts and can retire adequately.  For those who really need financial aid, again there are many outlets and schemes available.  I hope you did some research before questioning my comment about training. There are PCP programmes, your first post-grad diploma is heavily subsidised up to 90% and for some specialties an employer is even found for you to sponsor you for the programme. Maybe you should read up more before making ignorant comments.  Who ask you to commit to an expensive HDB or condo in the first place? You make choices like this and when you fail the government is suppose to pick up the tab for you? Don’t be a joke.  Again I repeat. No manager will hire or keep employed an underperforming staff. I find your argument very weak and unbelievable.  This will be my last reply. I find it challenging to speak to someone who doesn’t read up on facts, is not open minded, and gives anecdotal “evidence” that on its own doesn’t not even make sense.   Good luck to you and the numerous other Singaporeans who think like you. Those who do not, will move on and upwards while you stay and whine. ",0,en

Dubai is a heavily monitored city and some don’t like it. China is communist of course and there is talk now that the CCP wants to take rich tycoons’ wealth and redistribute it to the people. Just like that, by fiat.   It’s the same rhetoric from all foreign businesses operating here: lack of freedom to hire talent from anywhere and the local talent pool is small. We have heard this many times.   It’s hard to comment on your case but Singaporeans will want to know: have you advertised for locals, say, with the jobs bank at WSG or with NTUC e2i? How many Singaporeans have you interviewed? What is lacking in the Singaporean candidates?  The issue is that Singaporeans don’t believe that you have sincerely tried hard enough. Singapore supposedly has one of the best education and vocational training systems in the world. Singapore’s universities rank amongst the top 20 in the world, so are our polytechnics. Where else do you find govt subsidies of up to 90% for training? Surely all that investment in training Singaporeans must mean something. So, you can understand why Singaporeans find it incredulous that you cannot find the talents you need amongst the locals.   Like I said, without knowing what business you were in and what you were looking for, it’s hard for me to say if you have tried hard enough. But that’s also what Singaporeans are asking businessmen like you. Have you tried hard enough or you don’t think you have any responsibility to prioritise Singaporeans over foreigners while enjoying the great infrastructure and business environment that Singaporeans have built for you? If it is the latter, then Singapore doesn’t welcome you.

"Leonard Tan In Germany, the Germans or Finland or Sweden jobs will not be replaced by the foreigners at all time. The German never  need to worry to lose their jobs to foreigners as their German law protects their German citizens very strong to the extend if any company want to employ any foreigners they have to justify that they couldn't get the local to fill in the job application. And even so, it's was so strict to the extent their local companies had 99.8% hard time of justifying to let the foreigners to fill in the job application. It's like mission impossible. Opposite of Singapore.   Please kindly take note we have the BEST education system and BEST and huge percentage of well education work force why can't they get a job or a really good pay job and why a lot of them including graduates have to become Grab drivers or deliverymen and be distancing ambassadors or even other lower pay jobs when expats are highly paid with all perks.  Are their high pay jobs really can't be filled by the local graduates and highly educated local??? It's really like telling bs. We have the best education system and the best and highest percentage of overall well educated local workforce. We are more concern about higher job position White collars jobs not those blue collar jobs that the govt is stressing.   Our Singapore leaders have to take note the main thing why this is raised up over past fifteen years or more is because it's totally overlooked by the leaders and closed two eyes even until now.   And now the Pandemic had worsen the situation to extreme. People are angry and upset now for real reason.   The right way as a leader to do now is not to shift their responsibilities and  stop using globalisation as a excuse. And rectify  it in the right way.    Germany is also under going globalisation. Not just Singapore and other countries.   It is a matter how strong our Singapore law is protecting our local citizens and make sure they have the good safety net of not losing their jobs no matter what and get a good pay.    Others are all lame  excuses in the eyes of local citizens. It's how you play this chess game of globalisation. If any good leaders recognise the fact that they had did a mistake they should admit openly and stop saying they are doing a good job when everyone is struggling and fear of losing jobs at anytime or even worst totally have no jobs. Any good leader should implement a strong law to protect the local not to lose their jobs to foreigners at any circumstances unless special situation. If they need a reference, check the Germany law how they protect their local from losing jobs.   Germans don't worry to lose their jobs. The Germans  have a safety net of retirement as well. Their worries is only how to spend their next holiday on summer and winter. Unlike local Singaporeans, worry how to get good pay job or Job to feed the family.  Imagine a local minister lost his job to the foreign minister in a blink. How will he felt?? And couldn't find another minister job and plus addition clause that he cannot sitting as director in any corporation to get any dividend or extra income. Total zero income .How will the minister feel? Whole Family to feed and his landed house mortgage to pay and family expense to pay.   Be understanding to the local people real worries and concerns.

"You see how Shanmugan literally belittled him all the way.  Some will say minister is bullying him but in politics, there is not such thing as 'give chance'. This is not a game of cards but it is about your live and mine. Hence, if we have such people in parliament, the government must ridicule them to the maximum and kill their political career away as we cannot afford to have such people representing us in parliament when you cannot even get your points across properly and when you do not know what you are talking about in parliament, the official place where important issues are raised and debated and implemented for the good of Singapore.  To those silly people who keep saying why minister and speaker act in this way and is unbecoming, these stupid people really need to open their eyes. Do you see them doing this to Pritam or other opposition members who talk sense? Answer is no. If you do not want to be looked down, then go and do your homework and make sure you can answer questions and also ask relevant questions and not stupid questions. Parliament is a sacred place and not a place for stupidity.  The main beneficiary of all these saga is WP where they are now seen as a reasonable opposition party and in the way they conduct themselves in parliament. Even Pritam raised questions about it but you can see he is at least asking proper questions and putting things into context.  And then you look at LMW. Not only does he not know what he is talking about, he is also stubborn and refused to listen to anyone till the point he had to ask the minister to repeat himself 3 times! My goodness. And it was a simple question. If we have such people to represent us in government, I can guarantee Singapore will be run to the ground in half a year.

"Clarification is much appreciated here and hence it important to be sought out in the house . The motion is mooted so wrongly. Sorry to say, he initiated and yet kept saying about the social impact? How do we not able to  reflect on this matter with our own experiences in life? Isnt displacment in any sector be it PMET or any areas, it is Always the  cycle we hate to see. From Age 40 and above, workforce often  displaced than others age groups. Too common to see. If you were young once, you knew you had accidentally displaced the one who was older than you by 20 years. You were paid 1.8K in 2000 and he was paid 4.5k then. Why chose over you and retrenched him.  Cos it is economical and more viable to do so. Some hit hard and yet some moved on in life.  Nothing went different from then till now. The same cycle continued to  happen in SG when the salaries turned competitive.  To address social effect from these policies and how these impacted on Singapore, ""Core Singaporean"" has been the right approach and PM lee has already addressed that He will look into these matters.  Housing, education and all others are taken into considerations.  What we, ourselves should do and  need to, is to focus on upskill and keep ourselves relevant at work.   Personally, we have seen many people doing well again  by taking new and lower positions , reskill and re position themselves in new sectors. It is not about immediate failure but about being resilient to difficutlies . The whole one hour is painful to watch if we focus on the motion. For goodness sake, raise it properly. Words are precious in the House. Choose your words wisely.  It is important to understand the essencd of what being discussed in the house. The house is still in order. However the comments are just one sided. Please be fair to the house. You are given a choice to start a debate, you pick your motion and your direction is so wrong.

"Today, we live in a highly interconnected world, both physically and virtually, kudos to advanced and reliable transportation and high-speed and low-cost telecommunications. It is vital that Singapore remains open to progressive nations, and continues to build bridges with every part of the world. As a global hub, we have to stay open to talents, investments and visitors. However, the government needs to be conscious of the anxiety in the community. The anxiety may be related to job security and career inspirations, basic needs in housing, education and healthcare, costs of living, even social and community identity. These concerns may not be totally unfounded, although some may be overly inflated. There is no doubt Singapore is faring well in most areas, but there may be policies that need some calibration.",0,en

" From tan chin Bok fb post   A Robust debate  Last night’s Parliamentary debate (14th September), is an important reminder to Singaporeans on the significance of having an alternative voice in parliament.  The debate which lasted till after midnight, was robust and lively. Government policies were carefully examined and scrutinised. Now the public knows more then it ever did before.   And I trust that the public will be able to tell that the issue at stake is not race or racism, but jobs, lives and livelihoods.  Our 2 NCMPs fought hard. Despite difficult odds, they endured relentless attacks and even disrespectful insults from PAP MPs. Yet with great courage and tenacity, they persevered – and I am very proud of them.  Some have criticised their performance but it is easy to forget that this is only their 1st term. They have learnt much from this session. And this will be one of many occasions where they will need to stand firm and hold their ground in the face of overwhelming odds.   The issue at stake is not race and racism, but Singaporean jobs, Singaporean lives and Singaporean livelihoods.   They are holding the Government accountable to provide answers to Singaporeans - let’s not forget that. We must not lose focus.  Thank you Mun Wai and Hazel for standing up for Singaporeans and bringing their voice to Parliament.

"To touch on entrepreneurship, it is much harder in a smaller country. It is easier to be successful with a larger market. Mr Bean, if it's a US business that has found traction in one US city, would have expanded to 500 stores instead of just 30 stores in SG. Someone with a proven formula that worked in Shenzhen, would find that it is easy to seek investors for him to expand to Guangzhou and Shanghai. But if someone in Singapore has 20 stores and want to expand to Malaysia or China, faces an uphill task convincing investors the formula will work its magic in other countries.   So the lack of a business spirit is not just about education and culture. There is a larger risk to run a business in a small population.",4,en

"Singapore or any other foreign countries for that matter, lacks certain resources which deprives economic growth and progress, and always pays a price on its ride upwards, and likely to decline as its peak reached. Let's hope it does not go FULL CIRCLE and back to the starting point, cause on its way up many values will be lost along the way and we forget that we have it all in the first place...When we started with no natural resources, it was the great human capital management that saved the day, but seems to have eroded over time (otherwise we would not be having this debate).  Agrees with inevitability of a more ""inclusive"" eco-system that evolved over the years. The basic core prudence of it all is the balanced management of the entire eco-system, but when the top management of any organization is replaced by (for whatever reasons) by foreign elements, it breeds the start of ""conflict of interests"" against local elements. The importance of losing the top positions would ultimately endanger the local interests in favor of foreign interests, especially in the finance and human resource related positions.

"Sandra Bonazza Try to see things from a different perspective. It isn't wrong for anyone to travel out of their homeland in search of better oppptunities. But is the hiring practice even fair in reality?  We've always been told that Singaporeans lacked the worldview and regional experience that some job roles require thus foreigners are hired to fill in these roles, however, some of these foreigners are being employed on the basis of preferential treatment, and they too do not have any or much regional experience. This is prevalent in the context of MNCs  Unlike bigger economies, Singapore's market size and industries are very small. Local PMETs are often hired to fill in ""operational roles"" - basically entry to mid-level roles that keeps the company operational. Once we hit 40 years old, we risk being retrenched and replaced with someonr younger and cheaper. As such, most jobs and positions have no prospect. Management and leadership roles are often given to foreigners because they are ""more experienced"".  This isn't helping our workforce and economy.  We welcome foreigners and we certainly need foreigners to bolster our technology and economy, but at what expense? We need to grow our own talent pool too. The current framework the govt had is outdated. It just continues to depreciate the value, prospects and standing of our local talent pool. In a blunt way, we are nothing but slaves to foreign firms.",0,en

"Peter Pang Hi Peter, thanks for your reply. Indeed, my previous post is very telegraphic but on purpose.  Frankly speaking posts are always subjected to misunderstanding.  Anyway, it is a pleasure to exchange my opinion with you, since you ask for.   Yes, I believe (history is proving this) that human nature is made to evolve to survive also through travelling and adapting. So going around the world looking for better opportunities (jobs) or just for a personal experience it is fair (not only money counts, but it is needful). Especially for a small country as Singapore I would say. Otherwise, you will risk imploding in your own mentality without any new “oxygen” and “DNA” (both physical and mental).   As all countries also SG needs foreigners. We have a lot to exchange. You attract western companies because of your stable gov, your location in the middle of Asia, you give us the opportunity to have new experiences, to live in one of the most safe city in the world, you offer a real international expat community. In exchange we bring our companies here: SG choose to grow in a short time – 50 years – Europe took much more because we started from zero with the Industrial Revolution. So, we try to bring our experience. But we all should not underestimate that we left our family, tradition, loves and culture behind. This also has a price, not quantifiable in money. Personally, I am not seeing my family since 2019 because we are not allowed to go and come back (only Chinese and maybe few other can). We don’t want your charity and we don’t work for charity (we can’t accept to go abroad, in the most expensive city and live with money problems / see costs for schools, insurance, houses…etc)  About Leadership. What I learned in these 7 years is that it is not enough to be the best academically, not enough to copy paste a method. What is completing a human being is mostly his personal experiences. Including emotionally. To be a leader you need many qualities that are developed in the field since we are born. Too many rules and “rescue buoy” can mutilate our capability to find solutions, our creativity with problem solving, interaction with people. Having procedures for everything it makes our sense of analyse just a task to follow without any personal judgement and contribution. Starting from the kindergarten, the only reason to grow successfully is to have a nice school to have the best job to make more money. All is given to the academic part and almost nothing to the emotional maturity which is a big part of our personality.   To be a successful company you need successfully people. To be a successful person you need to grow and mature in both fields: schooling and emotionally, brain and heart. Unless we are only interested in our own community, and we don’t want to be empathetic with the rest of the world.   At the end what I think is that western companies are not happy or prefer to pay such big salaries to expats. But they have no choice because local HR are not ready yet (reasons explained.). Your gov is super protective with locals, to employ an expat you must pay much more, you have the job security (local first) and, let me say this, you are spoiled without even realizing it.  If Singaporeans become competitive you won’t have any frustration not only in SG but also in the rest of the world... which is always a wonderful experience.   ",0,en

Why all PAP MPs never ask in Parliament sessions on why thousands of people from India come to Singapore to find PMET jobs and replace Singapore born Singaporeans working adults as a result in the past 20 years?

"OYK:Words gradually became deeds, and toxic views turned into verbal and physical assaults on Indians, including our citizens.

His statement make it as though verbal and physical 'assaults' ( OYK's statement )  is  rampant; he has unjustly exacerbated the situation.  When he mentioned "" including our citizens, does he mean that our true blue indians, then not he incites disharmony between the implicit ethnic group and our true blue indians.

"My very own experience, I encountered it myself. Not only middle or high management affected. Even those junior/senior executive level also affected.   It was many years back (unfortunately i believe it is still happening now, this CECA or other Workforce foreign PMET jobs policies thing)   I was out of job and went to an interview at a local company. During the interview the HR told me to lower my pay expectation (the thing is I am not even asking for high pay) they offer me a ridiculously low pay. And told me that the salary I asked, they can actually hire foreigners with good university degree at a much lower competitive salary doing the same job scope.   I am a father with young child. I can’t afford to accept such pay. I did not accept the salary they offer me. I actually walked out feeling very depressed and shocked. And was asking myself “what is happening to Singapore ?”.  I can never forget that feeling.  It is totally unprofessional for a HR to tell me this. But at least i know the truth. The truth of how a gov policy can also affect how companies hire as well as how a country develop.  I am not being xenophobic here. I have worked with foreign colleagues. Some are really competent and hardworking. I do welcome foreigners. I do understand that Singapore do not have natural resources and one of the way is having a large effective workforce that can fuel the country’s economic growth. I also understand that Singapore can’t depend on just Singaporean workforce alone to sustain this economy.  But it shouldn’t be coming in by the millions and shouldn’t be just focusing on GDP of the “country” to compete with surrounding countries. Without taking into much consideration into any social impact it will course.  These have been happening in the pass 20 years. The people who are being alert are already voicing out many years ago. But still the ordinary folks believe the incumbent party can work this out, so incumbent have the mandate to push through these policies without much regards.   Some of the key reasons companies choose to set-up business in Singapore is because of stable government, safe environment, well developed infrastructure, knowledgeable workforce (to a certain extend), majority of locals able to communicate in English a universal language used in business and documents and ease of doing business here.  If those companies think it is not so great setting up operations in Singapore and required majority of talents from a certain country or certain countries, then better for them to set up their business in that other country instead.   Because we can’t just let companies pander to all the benefits of a country yet does not bring much social and job creation to the locals of a country that they are operating in.  It just sound sad that the parliament is discussing about Singaporean core and fair treatment of locals.   I see other countries implement policies to protect its own citizens or even protect the current population. But in Singapore ... haiz.  Now giving the same or similar promise again ? .",32,en

I have come across foreigners doubting and cursing Singapore that it will fail. But they were proven wrong. But the new generation does not appreciate and has taken the prosperity for granted. Younger generation has not seen tough times and have had a comfortable and cushy life. Singapore success is too good to be true. I worry if younger Singaporeans get short sighted and anti Government and go with anecdotal evidence to draw conclusions and emotionally responding to issues. We have to get over it and see things with proper perspective. But I am not sure if people will see. People like to believe what they want to believe. One option for Singaporeans is to vote PAP out of power and WP and its allies to form the next Government. We will know the value of PAP if opposition rules. We have seen their qualities in debate and raising questions. But they are playing politics and whipping up emotions. If WP and its allies form the next Government, we will have Sylvia Lim as PM. Pritam cannot be PM as he is Singapore Indian. Jamus LIm will be FM, rope in Leong Mun Wai as Trade minister, etc. and form your list of ministers. Dr. Chee could be made to contest Presidency so that he can have the key to the reserve. The economic and social fall out will be tremendous. May be we need to experience so that the new generation experiences for themselves what it is to Govern. I keep thinking if Singapore can go on prospering but it is the people who decide.

"PAP widely publicity of Indian Foreign Talents with experience and with expertise are actually retrenched IT staff from India.  They come to Singapore and our own Singapore born Singaporean PMET becomes retrenched or terminated as a result and replaced cheap IT personnel from India.   This is what I am very worried 😟 😟 😟 for Singapore born Singaporeans and their families.  21 June 2017  RETRENCHMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO HIT INDIA'S IT AND BPO INDUSTRIES  India's information technology (IT) industry and business process outsourcing (BPO) service providers were once hailed by the media as a miracle of sorts, the pride of India and the industry was India's largest employer or at least India's largest private sector employer, which employed millions of people and it was rather glamorous to be an IT workers in India.  Indian IT workers have also been a rather fortunate lot compared to their counterparts elsewhere in that Indian IT companies once maintained up to 20% or more of them on standby on full pay to be immediately deployed on projects as and when needed, but this practice is coming to an end in favour of short term contracts, as India's IT companies increasingly come under rising cost pressures.  However of late, India's IT and BPO services  industry have been retrenching workers by the thousands, with the ""big boys"" of Indian IT planning to retrench as many as 200,000 staff.  The commentator in the first video below gives a good analysis of the financial factors affecting India's IT industry in terms of the strengthening exchange rate of the Indian Rupee versus the US dollar. Since most IT or BPO contracts are quoted in US dollars to customers in the US and also in most other countries, a stronger Rupee vs the US dollar means that the company in India earns fewer Rupees in numerical terms, once those US dollars are repatriated to India and converted to Rupees.   He also mentioned that with India's IT multinationals being compelled to hire more American workers at their facilities in the US at American pay levels, India's IT multinationals end up having to pay more in salaries than if they imported IT workers from India to work on H1-B visas, so to contain costs, they have to retrench their workers in India.",0,en

"This is another article where PAP can pick and choose retrenched or surplus cheap Indian IT talent into Singapore and not have to hire expensive but capable, experience and knowledgeable Singapore born Singaporean IT genuine professionals.  Synopsis  Industry lobby group National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has sought furloughs and temporary layoff of surplus employees, relaxing daily and weekly work-hour limits, allowing women to work at night from home and a self.  By Surabhi Agarwal, ET BureauLast Updated: May 29, 2020, 10:20 AM IST8  NEW DELHI: The Indian IT industry has asked state governments to extend labour laws relaxations to the services industry, arguing that it would help the $191 billion sector, chiefly reliant on global customers, to cope with the “severe economic downturn” caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Industry lobby group National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has sought furloughs and temporary layoff of surplus employees, relaxing daily and weekly work-hour limits, allowing women to work at night from home and a self-declaration regime to comply with government rules.  It has also sought waiver on the need to provide a 21-day notice to government and employees before making policy changes as well as an exemption from mandatory onboarding of apprentices. Over the last week, Nasscom has written to four states – UP, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat – that have given some exemptions to industrial units and manufacturers from labour laws, seeking that the IT sector be covered under the new rules.  The four states have exempted companies under the Factories Act, which does not cover firms in the services sector, including IT and IT-enabled Services companies.  “Most of the states, such as UP, have given blanket exemption from all laws to manufacturing companies, except two-three Acts. We don’t want blanket exemptions, but we also don’t want the IT sector to be left out while these labour law changes are being made,” said Ashish Aggarwal, head – public policy at Nasscom.  The IT-ITeS sector is facing a severe economic downturn, especially small and medium units, he said, as many global clients across the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors have been completely disrupted and clients in manufacturing and services have also been severely impacted. “The industry is in dire need of labour law reforms in order to drive back recovery. At this crucial hour, it is necessary to ease business conditions in the form of well-thought labour law reforms,” Ashish Aggarwal added.  The labour law reforms, if carried out, are expected to benefit companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Tech and Genpact which are the industry’s top employers, as well as smaller companies. Industry leaders say the demand for restructuring labour laws is not new and has been debated for over 15 years with little success.  ""There should be flexibility allowed to organisations, of course which should be used in a decent and humane fashion. Most of it comes from not trusting employers to be fair to their employees,” P Srikar Reddy, CEO of Sonata Software, advocating uniform laws for all sectors. “Perhaps, one or two companies may not be ethical in dealing with their employees but because of that, everyone is suffering.”  Nasscom has argued that IT-ITeS sector should be allowed to temporarily lay off surplus workforce with payment of a 50% compensation or minimum wages, whichever is less, during the layoff period, without compromising on the employee’s statutory entitlements, which will do away with the need for retrenchment of employees.

The unconscious biases we have tends to flare up when we see something which isn’t the way our mind is conditioned to assume. One hypotheses is, in the past decades most of the PMET population was overwhelmingly the majority race, a few from minority and then a sprinkling number of western expats and that status quo was comforting since the ratio equation was to the populations liking . In the recent decade the rise of tech and finance MNC’s have led to a larger pool of FT’s and within which there is a larger Indian nationals who have filled in many Senior and middle level managers and leadership roles . Obviously this new changed workplace reality/population mix does impact the ‘privileged thinking’ that may be part of an unconscious  bias amongst some of those working in such work places. This along with proliferation of vested social media pages that amplify divisive shrill noises that try to sow xenophobic discomfort tend to create a internal discomfort/ hatred to fester as these messagings aim to gaslight those unconscious biases that inherently are part of us.  The series of negative incidents linked to racial and xenophobic causes are a reflection of how well a small section of that divisive force  has been able to expand and cause temporary blindness towards facts and rationale , reasoning and pragmatism and  indeed the globalised & open mind set that is the hallmark of Singapore’s wider progressive-population .",0,en

And we have heard a few years back about a Filipina HR hiring more from her country than others. Chinese are not immune to this. Singling out one race is wrong based on a couple of examples. Tech jobs are available in plenty and not many takers. Couple of my ex colleagues lost their jobs in the service industry and tried several months to get a job but did not work. Now they make a living as Grab drivers. Point to note is that they are not tech people to benefit from many jobs available in the tech and Fin tech sectors. Pandemic has led to disruption in hospitality, retail and service industries. Job loses here cannot be compared to the gains in tech sectors where there is more demand than supply. While our universities are world class, they don’t produce enough to meet the demand in the tech sectors. Try to recruit a Java programmers, you will find it a struggle to recruit locals. But many companies need Java programmers. We should not make apples and oranges comparison and get emotional. Very easy to whip up emotions. ",0,en

This where locals are largely employed and this sector is affected by Covid. Tech sector and Fin Tech have plenty of jobs. Don’t compare the lose of local jobs in one industry or sector with tech and Fin tech. Banks are hiring and not cutting. Banks need more in the personal banking.

But when you see a sudden influx from Indian Nationals taking jobs that our locals can easily fill and experiencing huge migrants from India in the East and North East residential area, the Chinese, Malays, and even our local Indians feel like a minority race. Simply said, it feels like an invasion. Can the government please explain this phenomenon if I may describe it?   To this date, the Government has failed to show us factual statistics and specific details of how the Ceca has benefited Singapore. I have no doubt that HSK has negotiated on this CECA agreement to the best of Singapore's interest but somewhere along the way, there could be some oversight and miscalculation that the government finds hard to admit.  And looking at the Covid19 situation in India, it is even more concerning. So, it seems like a double whammy for Singapore.   Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against India. But Singapore's interest must remain preeminent when it comes to Ceca.   National interest is a matter of the greatest prudence. Some interests are immediate and others long-term. Some are absolutely vital, some important, others minor and marginal. And in general, interests change according to changing circumstances and that we know. Therefore, it is important that the government must consistently be transparent and communicate honestly and effectively with Singaporeans.   ",56,en

"My Personal Opinion:  1) Short courses like WSQ (apart from mandatory modules for jobs like cleaning, security, safety, training and etc) does not help to find job as Employee because lack of proper qualification.  2) Short course only good if you want to top up current practice and new skills in your industry or you need this new knowledge to provide your services as Trainer/Consultant. Mostly its benefits Freelancers rather than Employees.  3) Singaporeans are educated people and once they are out of ‘Employee’ status, they will mostly end up becoming a Trainer/Consultant as a Freelancer or Boss. If Government don’t focus on creating jobs indirectly in Training Industry, there will be more social unrest in Singapore.  4) According to how our statistics work, you do not consider as ‘Unemployed’ if you study full time studies which most Approved Training Organisations (ATOs)’ courses break into day and night classes but never full and part time classes. 5a) Singapore have 3 levels which is ITE Certificate, Polytechnic Diploma and University Degree while other countries have only 2 levels which is Non-Graduate (Certificate and Diploma) and Graduate (Degree).  5b) ITE train Graduates to do blue collar positions like Admin Assistant and Technician. ITE Graduates consider ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’. On another hand, we have Foreigners like Malaysians holding SPM (equivalent to our GCE O) who are ‘Untrained’. But Singapore Employers prefer to hire Malaysians for blue collar positions because they are more ‘committed to work’ like working OT with or without OT pay and their basic wages is lower than Singaporeans.  5c) In this case, ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’ is no longer a concern to Singapore Employers because they can always provide OJT to them at workplace.  -----------  My Complaint about Singapore Public Education:  6a) Singapore is top 1st or 2nd in the world for Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) while our neighbour, Malaysia, is 400+ ranking for PISA. Is there a need for Singapore Government to raise the education standard that increase unnecessary stress that lead to suicide?  6b) Most of the world like Malaysia only have 1 main stream which will allow Secondary School Graduates to be ‘Year 10 Standard’ competency. With SPM, Malaysians can used it to enter our Polytechnic in Singapore at the age of 18 year old because their Secondary School education is a 5 years programme (from 13 to 17 year old). Our GCE O Graduates from Express stream enter Polytechnic at the age of 17 year old.  6c) On another hand, Singapore Government created many streams to prevent Singaporeans from getting higher education. I will used Normal Technical (NT) stream as an example.  6d) Our NT GCE N Graduates are force to enter ITE for Nitec (2 years programme from 17 to 18 year old) and follow by Higher Nitec (2 years programme from 19 to 20 year old) before they enter Polytechnic at the age of 21 year old. This is provided NT GCE N Graduates with ITE qualification (Nitec / Higher Nitec) are able to get a good Grade Point Average (GPA) to secure a place for higher education (Higher Nitec / Polytechnic Diploma) or else they are force to enter workforce at a young age. I did not even include the time for National Services (NS) and Time Wasted on waiting to enlist and higher education school reopen.  6e) So why can’t Singapore Government allow NT GCE N Graduates to study directly for Diploma at ITE or Polytechnic instead of wasting time and effort on Certificate (Nitec and Higher Nitec) level?  6f) Some may say NT GCE N Graduates are stupid which is the reason why Certificate (Nitec and Higher Nitec) level needs to be created for them. This is not true. According to Worker Improvement through Secondary Education (WISE) programme conducted by ITE, NT GCE N is equal to Normal Academic (NA) Secondary 2 level which at best consider at ‘Year 8 Standard’ in the world. Singapore Government short-change NT GCE N Graduates in general education which they are 3 years shy away from competent to take GCE O exams. This is the reason why ITE Graduates with NT GCE N will have a hard time in higher education like Polytechnic that lead to barely pass or even fail from programme.  6g) So why do Singapore Government want to shortchange Singaporeans in term of general education?  -----------  In My Conclusion:  7) When it comes to Training/Education, Singapore Government will incorporate with their political ideology.  8 ) Singapore Government never consider Training/Education is important to Singaporeans and only wayang by appearing to support Training/Education Movement to Singaporeans.  9) For example, Singapore needs Foreigners as Specialised Domain Experts (SDE) because Singaporeans do not have that competency. But did Singapore Government step in to ensure the SDE skills and knowledges are pass down to Singaporeans? The answer is no which is the reason why Singapore forever needs to rely on Foreigners.  10) Another example will be my point 5b, do Singapore Government step up to enforce Employers to hire candidates for positions like Technician must be a ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’ person? The answer is no which is the reason why Singaporeans will lose their competitive compare to Foreigners which Training will never make up for the lost.",4,en

"1) Fake credentials from Foreign Talents (FTs) like working experience, qualification and etc, are common in Singapore but how can Government ensure a good background verification was done on FTs because it had a big impact on everyone life in Singapore?   2a) A good example will be Shankar, an assistant professor with the Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine at NUS' Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine from 2005 to 2008.  2b) National University of Singapore (NUS) is a Publicly-Funded Autonomous University and how did NUS measure if Shankar meet the requirement to become an Assistant Professor and hire him?  2c) All medical practitioners must be registered with Singapore Medical Council (SMC) and issued a Practising Certificate (PC) before they can practise medicine in Singapore. SMC will needs to grants at least a Temporary Registration to international medical graduates who are in Singapore for teaching, research or postgraduate study in medicine under an SMC-approved training programme. How did SMC measure if Shankar meet the requirement to become a Medical Practitioner?  2d) Ministry of Manpower (MOM) issued work pass to Shankar and what was used for measuring to ensure he meet the requirement?   2e) MOH Holdings Pte Ltd (MOHH) maybe involved in Shankar’s case since MOHH is doing the role of ‘centralized recruiter’ for healthcare positions like Physician. If this is true, how did MOHH measure if Shankar meet the requirement to join a career as Physician related occupation?  3) Foreigners like Shankar can always fake their qualification and experience to increase their chance of securing any job in Singapore including public sector and 3 to 4 of our government agencies fail to detect a single person. In this case, it will be harder for private sector to detect fake qualification and experience from Foreigners.  4) There is no way for Singaporeans to fake their qualification and experience because it can be easily detected since we can do a background verification with Local Schools and documents like CPF contribution from Employers.   5) In this case, Singaporeans will always lose when it comes to job competition because Singaporeans do not have a resume more beautiful than Foreigners.",2,en

Many arrived armed with PR statuses and have never visited the country and with no strong financial or economic contribution to the country, or possess any special skills except accompanying kids. The study mamas were a problem cos many were not even the kids’ mothers. And these study mamas were stealthily working, and conducting unapproved businesses out HDB flats, some of them got PR status, bought a flat, rent it out and moved back to China. Things also started changing when China became less enamoured of Singapore. This protective sentiment is seen in so many countries around the world and many govts are involved.

To simplify for you, there are certain data that you had ask for that should never be disclosed. One example will be what you said about ""the successful of any negotiation"". One does not disclose their original objectives pre-negotiation nor impacts from deviations so that the other side will not feel that we have made use of them (if we bargained over our original objectives), or provide points of attacks for future negotiation (if we made compromises).

"We have to see the debate in perspective and be objective to see if Singaporeans’ interests are served well for short term and most importantly long term.    1/ Pandemic has disrupted many industries Globally in particular aviation, tourism, hospitality, F&B and other services where large % of locals are employed. Singapore is even more impacted on these sectors as we have no domestic market or domestic tourism unlike China, India, and the US. China’s domestic tourism is now at the pre-pandemic level. So are India and the US.    2/ Global and Regional companies set up operations in Singapore not to serve Singapore market which is tiny for them but to serve the region and the world. Singaporeans who are plugged into their regional and Global aspirations will do well and have been doing well. This means developing leadership qualities and new skills to serve external market. Singaporeans should focus on this as this the vital gap that exists. Top quality education as it exists in Singapore that does not prepare Singaporeans well for complexity and Chaos, but it provides theoretical expertise and knowledge. Rising in the corporate world requires ability to navigate the region and if it means working outside of Singapore for a while. The quality to understand complexity and chaos come naturally to those who come from bigger markets – US, Europe, India, China, Philippines, etc. Point is we should serve the region in our employment role and not get stuck in serving small markets if one must rise and progress.   3/ Pandemic has accelerated digitalization exponentially. And the skills required are very different and the demand is very high. Singapore Universities and Polys, though rated very well, cannot meet the demand. We can increase by 20% but it is still not enough. Singapore cannot afford to restrict talents in this IT and other engineering sectors. If we do, companies will move out and IT jobs can be done from anywhere now. Even in India, there is tremendous shortage of IT talents, and you have to Google to see the offers IT graduates are getting. First choice of Indian IT talent is US, Canada, and Europe not Singapore. We must fight hard to get these talents. Talk to IT companies and you will know. That is why we have so many unfilled IT positions.    4/ Can we substantially increase student intakes and train in IT from very early days? Yes, but it is not going to help meet the demand. Writing code is not a rising career and learning them will not help as a person can get stuck. But Exposure early stages will help to appreciate, and that knowledge will help. Most important is to realize that we don’t have adequate population base to keep supplying to meet the demand. Not all students have aptitude for engineering and Information technology. We cannot force. This is where India has an advantage. Millions study IT every year and discount the schools that are not good enough, but India will still produce few hundred thousand IT engineers every year. And close to 170K go to US every year as the demand is very high for this talent in the US and other countries in the West. Stop whining and accept the realities. The reality could be to shut the door to IT industries and the companies who need IT talents, but we will all suffer. We will lose regional investment and dislocation of those who are already here. Always remember Global and regional companies are not in Singapore to serve local market but to serve the region.   5/ Xenophobia and racism are mental disease. You can’t get agitated by seeing expats (Indians) and assume that they are all through CECA. Indians have been in senior position in Global and Regional companies for a very long period. Not all are in IT industries. Many are in leadership positions and brough here by their companies who have made huge investment. Around 20 Global CEO of tech companies and non-tech companies are Indians born and bred in India.    6/ Singaporeans must shed this parochial outlook and start behaving like a Global Citizen. We have the education and qualities, but xenophobia and racism will pull us back. We learn to embrace diversity and enjoy working with multiple cultures. Joy and learning are different.    Needless to highlight that we should have stricter policies, guidelines, and rules to weed out abuses that impact Singaporeans. But that is work in progress as the minister says. Understand the macro picture and let’s work out micro actions required. Let’s not push the country backward and collectively lower our living standards.  ",3,en

"good policies will have unintended consequences.  the parliament debate must not revolve around whether being open is good or bad because it is clear that it has benefited the economy.    parliament debate must be more focused on addressing the gaps, which all parties acknowledge.    the greatest beneficiaries of FT  are the C-suites of both foreign + local businesses. the losers are the displaced Singaporean salaryman.    this should be the focus instead.   solution need not be complicated.  it is simply this :  beneficiaries must be made to pay for the displaced Singaporean salaryman by channelling taxes collected and economic growth back to the many ""left- behind"" average Singaporean salaryman.   economic growth is a means.  the means has already been achieved. it only left to be distributed properly.  this is the gap! if distrbution of wealth / opportunity is done properly,  ensuring nobody is left behind,  there is also no need to tighten immigration. stellar economic achievements is not complete unless it ensures growth is shared by all. govt must be willing to spend and invest in it's people. take some risks in helping the left-behinds get up to speed and those squeezed in between.    debate should focus on the ""how"" and specifics of distribution.    if done well,  it might also address the low birth rate problem because this issue is deeply entangled to jobs,  expenses anxiety and future prospects of the common man.    skillsfuture is very commendable but is only half the solution.  govt institutions like GIC, temasek etc must open its doors to provide trainee opportunities to passionate,  willing to learn individuals to help fill in the ""min. 3-yr experience"" required to land a job. set a good example for private businesses to follow.    FT has benefited some and displaced many. this is the crux and should be focus of debate!  the role of the govt is to act as active balancer to ensure nobody is left behind.   while tafep sounds good,  it is not practical.  while we're saying,  we're ""open"", tafep is on the other hand saying,  ""with conditions"" ..  these conditions are too fuzzy and ambiguous to enforce and it'll not be good to businesses.",0,en

"Truths Tan The PAP G is the one who let the situation festers to this stage with inaction. Why should I just accept their takes on the issues just like that? PSP has put up some proposals without the privilege of information and data to work on. Implementations and proposals are different matters and have to treated separately at the stage of debate. Even if the proposals come from PAP and eventually get implemented they may not achieve their initial goals discussed at Parliament debate. How fair is it to have their proposals slammed, mocked and dismissed just like that because the PAP must win!! TSL is the MOM minister that has just replaced JT. To me TSL doesn't look that confident when he tried to answer PSP Hazel Poa's questions on the possibility of errors on data classification for those stats that PAP put up. PAP counter arguments are based on their data which only the PAP G has access to. How do we know where they get their data or if these have been manipulated in some ways? How can we trust them if we don't know where the numbers come from esp when they are the cause of the problems?",0,en

"Wendy Lee  Getting a team of talents with proven track record is a big challenge. Highly capable men and women would find politics eroding their privacy and private time. It has to be a team of dozen senior leaders and grass root support system. Opposition has a long way to go to build such a team. LKY challenged opposition on this. We have had maverick individuals in opposition questioning and debating. JBJ did that and LKY had respect for him. But one or two people are not enough. Managing and providing leadership to a country is far more challenging and draining for a weak time. It is said in the corporate world that a leader has to surround himself with a strong team intellectually sharper and more experienced than him or her. LKY, in addition to be the visionary with great leadership skills, courage and character, surrounded himself with eminent individuals who formed his core team. Can opposition do that? I doubt it.

In addition, many Indian students graduate in the US with specialisation in AI, Machine learning, etc. And top students with the same skill sets move to US. Singapore is not the preferred destination contrary to many Singaporeans think. Google for the number of H1B visa given out every year in the US. And Singapore is given 3,000 H1B1 visa every year as part of the Singapore US FTA. But not more than couple of hundreds taken up by Singaporeans. Singaporeans who lose jobs in hospitality and service industry are not qualified to get these IT jobs unless they have the IT skills or upgrade themselves. Study the investment made by Singapore in India as part of CECA and benefits. India is an opportunity for Singapore companies to expand and diversify. The link between the two countries is historical going back 2,000 years. Singaporeans should show more awareness and understanding on this discussion.

Just as people do not apply for jobs that do not pay enough, employers don't hire anyone that won't help them earn enough.  2) Economy doesn't belong to the citizens. Economy is what citizens (including Govt officials who are too citizens) made it to be. Those that do learn economics know that GDP = Consumption of Goods + Investment + Govt Expenditure +  (Exports - Imports). While Govt makes economic policies, it is just a framework. Ultimately, it is citizens who made purchasing, investment and productivity decisions. Economy, the management of resources is a joint effort and the sum of economic activities of all citizens, not just the Govt.   To blame Govt for anything is also a form of irresponsible behaviour.  While we waste time pointing fingers, I think those that take the effort to improve their lives will win the race, not those who are in the habit of blaming others and not work hard and smart on their own.",2,en

To suggest Govt is not acting in our interest, kindly bring forth facts. As an IT Recruiter, having been to University Recruitment and do want to hire locals, I do see limited supply and as we expand digital economy so fast, there is just insufficient locals. Is pay low? No. Look at starting pay of IT graduates that increased so fast that some employers find it hard to catch up. GovTech is one of the reasons why pay for IT increased as they pay high with MOM making it difficult to get work passes to force industry to pay higher to attract locals to join IT industry. There are professional conversion programmes and last year many foreigners were retrenched and new work passes for those based overseas are hard to secure and more funding given to employers hiring those from professional conversion programmes. Are these not examples of acting in our interest?  On the other hand, I see some people trying to paint a picture that says otherwise to hinder growth which to me may then be acting against our interest until evidences are put forth for a reasonable and valid debate.

Pap model is to take advantage of others to secure election and their fat paycheck writing their own law as they control the wealth  You can talk until the cow come home  The people judgment are being distorted to only look at their own interest  Human biasness and resistance at their worse  Only america could wake pap up not opposition not me or anyone  The lawless mob behind privacy shield are exerting bad influence  It is to pap interest that this useless troublemakers control the nation who otherwise without pap will be poor  Whether it is to the nation interest remain debatable  But to my perspectives  I am confident we could do it on our own to create our wealth with private led model  Not this public led model to cheat to be wealthy feeding losers and troublemakers  Destroying the competitiveness and soul of the nation,0,en

"Gentle reminder that the debate is not about race or xenophobia. It is about whether CECA with India is indeed beneficial for Singapore, whether Singaporeans have been discriminated not even about being given preference when it comes to certain jobs, and lastly whether there is systemic abuse around loopholes that resulted in PRs and citizenship being given liberally so much that it has created enclaves in residential precincts (Bayshore and Melville Park being two more prominent ones) and in commercial/industrial parks (think C Business Park and M B Financial Centre).

"First of all why do employers today looked for PMET from outside SG, I think the answer is very simple. 1. SGporeans don’t want to do the job. 2. SGporeans wants higher salary. 3. SGporeans are not qualified enough or as good in certain sectors like IT for example. If qualified, then it will be back to point 2. So it is a fair play outside. Employers and business owners have to decide the  best interest of their companies to reduce cost and getting job done by engaging PMET from other countries. You can’t blame employers. And also Gov had already put a high quota for overseas employment already. What do you want them to do more? Running a business, it is not easy today and the overhead cost are high. ",8,en

"Aston Tay  our unemployment rate for citizens is about 4 % for  PMETs it is under 3 % this is very low, if you factor in seasonal and structural unemployment  its virtually zero. Crucially, We have more jobs than job seekers.   . That means all Singaporeans are employed. 54% of Singaporean workers are PMETs and the median income is 4.5k ish.  so if all Singaporeans are already employed and more than half are PMETs your logic doesn't make sense.   they benefit Singapore because :  1. They add to the workforce with new skills/contacts/exposure. Or even a warm body situation, all Singaporeans are employed and they add to the workforce working for Singapore   2. The EPs are also the ones who come here and set up businesses. They hire tens of thousands of Singaporeans . They benefit Singaporeans by giving them jobs.  3 Every person who moves to SIngapore spends money for rent, food, education, and family expenses. If they are paid by a foreign business, the money actually moves into the economy when they spend and the money in their bank accounts are part of our monies.  4. we are vey judicious in issuing passes. It is not easy to get them. EP and SP and PR numbers are quite carefully controlled. You can see it from the totals they have mantained.  We have a nice balanceand that is obviously careful to balance the needs of the nation. Like NUS and NTU,  ALL locals who qualify get in first..  then they add in foreigners to meet the quota .  So generally, Singaporeans have jobs and are doing very well.  For sure there will be some short term structural issues and some anecdotal stories of individuals who lost jobs to foreigenrs just as some foreigners will lose jobs to locals, firing and hiring and changing jobs is normal.

U mention only 3-4% Singaporeans,is unemployed and under 3% for PMET.  Do u hv the data to back up yr claim.  Does the nos includes all PMET tht are now driving Grab, doing food delivery etc?  Note tht PMET tht are employed does not mean PMET are employed in the area of their specialty.  Even among my friends, there are now does tht are doing food delivery and or unemployed.  2. Median income of 4.5K?  U knw wht median income is?  If i hv the top 10%earning millions and rest earning peanuts, tbe median income will still show them to hv high mefian income, no?  3. There is no doubt many of the foreign PMETs are beneficial to Singapore.  But we are talking abt CECA here and not the policy of bringing in PMETs.  If CECA is rrally gd and beneficial, why not show us the nos, tell us how these PMETS tht came in via CECA had benefitted us.  3. Every coin has 2 side.  No doubt some of these people tht came into Singapore will spend money etc.  But they had also drivinn up the cost of living so high tht many citizens are finding it hard to survive with 2 income!

Median income is putting all workers in a line based on income and you pick the middle person..  that person is earning 4.5k. Median isnt skewed by  large numbers.  3. How do they drive up the cost of living? That does not make sense. Maybe it makes houses in some areas more expensive but cost of living for the average Singaporean?

If your industry depends on qualifications and a standard work that anyone who know how then also your job is replaceable. A degree is nothing today. Anyone can be replaced if you are not directly involved in being revenue for the company. I’m glad I’m good at what I do which is non replaceable and that’s sales capabilities to close deals better than my peers. I don’t have high education but I think I’m doing better than those holding degree yet worrying about being retrenched. ",0,en

During this time I have seen Singaporeans who used to occupy 15 out of 30 long tables that sits 4 person per table reduced to the current 1 table on my office floor. so why did MAS estimates that citizens make up 70 per cent of the sector's workforce, with permanent residents (PRs) accounting for another 14 per cent. https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/mas-to-engage-financial-institutions-on-growing-their-sporean-workforce this is because as per retired senior banker Raymond Koh https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/forum-workforce-composition-in-banks-needs-to-be-examined had pointed out those foreigners have either become PRs who tear our flag https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/man-given-stern-warning-over-torn-flag-image or citizens who abuse our Merdeka generation https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/man-who-verbally-abused-condo-security-officers-union-says-it-stands-with-officers-his and still benefited from the Solidarity payout drawn from reserves that our Merdeka generation have help to build despite the damage they have done to Singapore Having india nationals as their managers Locals are often not groomed to do what their managers are doing to move up the career ladder with opportunities given to workers who share the same nationalities as their managers.Locals often seen their pay being stagnant as they did not get promoted even after working for a few years as they will be graded down when compared against similar workers who come from the same country as their manager even thought they are more competent than their india counterparts.

"Mark Lim now the questions are specific. Let me elaborate.  Singapore requires tech companies to set up in Singapore so that we can digitalise. Singapore have a very small amount of tech workers that can meet their demands. So if we want them to operate, we must allow tech specialists from somewhere else to top up the deficit. In comes India, where they have a large amount of tech and engineering schools pumping out a large amount of tech graduates. But their country do not have enough foreign investments to have tech openings. Since Singapore can draw investments and have openings, they come here to work for a tech company.  So how does this benefit Singapore?  1. Having tech companies here mean our local tech graduates get jobs. In fact they have one of the highest starting salaries compared to other industries.  2. Having tech companies here allow for more tech options for our local companies to utilise. Tech doesn't just include things consumers use, B2B tech are also important.  3. By retaining tech companies, hopefully more Singaporean, young and old, see that tech jobs are lucrative and go into this industries. This takes a long time for that to happen, so we need EPs to allow tech companies to operate here.  The alternative will be the tech companies operate somewhere else, and local companies pay them operating from other countries. Our tech graduates have lesser openings and they either get out of tech or go overseas. Not good for Singapore's future growth.",0,en

"My very own experience, I encountered it myself. Not only middle or high management affected. Even those junior/senior executive level also affected.   It was many years back (unfortunately i believe it is still happening now, this CECA or other Workforce foreign PMET jobs policies thing)   I was out of job and went to an interview at a local company. During the interview the HR told me to lower my pay expectation (the thing is I am not even asking for high pay) they offer me a ridiculously low pay. And told me that the salary I asked, they can actually hire foreigners with good university degree at a much lower competitive salary doing the same job scope.   I am a father with young child. I can’t afford to accept such pay. I did not accept the salary they offer me. I actually walked out feeling very depressed and shocked. And was asking myself “what is happening to Singapore ?”.  I can never forget that feeling.  It is totally unprofessional for a HR to tell me this. But at least i know the truth. The truth of how a gov policy can also affect how companies hire as well as how a country develop.  I am not being xenophobic here. I have worked with foreign colleagues. Some are really competent and hardworking. I do welcome foreigners. I do understand that Singapore do not have natural resources and one of the way is having a large effective workforce that can fuel the country’s economic growth. I also understand that Singapore can’t depend on just Singaporean workforce alone to sustain this economy.  But it shouldn’t be coming in by the millions and shouldn’t be just focusing on GDP of the “country” to compete with surrounding countries. Without taking into much consideration into any social impact it will course.  These have been happening in the pass 20 years. The people who are being alert are already voicing out many years ago. But still the ordinary folks believe the incumbent party can work this out, so incumbent have the mandate to push through these policies without much regards.   Some of the key reasons companies choose to set-up business in Singapore is because of stable government, safe environment, well developed infrastructure, knowledgeable workforce (to a certain extend), majority of locals able to communicate in English a universal language used in business and documents and ease of doing business here.  If those companies think it is not so great setting up operations in Singapore and required majority of talents from a certain country or certain countries, then better for them to set up their business in that other country instead.   Because we can’t just let companies pander to all the benefits of a country yet does not bring much social and job creation to the locals of a country that they are operating in.  It just sound sad that the parliament is discussing about Singaporean core and fair treatment of locals.   I see other countries implement policies to protect its own citizens or even protect the current population. But in Singapore ... haiz.  Now giving the same or similar promise again ? .",237,en

If such a clear explanation in parliament is beyond our collective comprehension, if we refuse to acknowledge the global trends, then I’m afraid that we gone as far as we could as a nation.   It is my personal opinion that the level of envy, jealousy and hate among of our fellow Singaporeans who refuses to compete or are simply unable to compete with genuine talents is spinning out of control.   Right now Singapore is globally connected and is within touch with cities such as New York, London, Tokyo, Shanghai etc. When our global status quo takes a turn for the worst, we’ll be in deep trouble.  The thing I can say to the younger generation of Singaporeans is that we as a nation are very fortunate to have world class leaders who are creating every possible avenue for us to develop our knowledge, talent and skills in order to compete with the best and created the environment for us to succeed but to compete with the best we must and that’s the first step forward.

In the early noughties Singapore was much more focused on the Asean-China FTA, which was signed in 2002 and led to an influx of China talent. That is the reason why the base % figure for Indian EPs is so low in 2005.   CECA was signed only in 2005, and ratified in 2006 so the base year is wrong.   Ultimately, the 26% figure is also ""wrong"", because so many Indian EPs and S-pass holders almost always attempt to take SPR or convert to Singaporeans hence the true impact from CECA is probably much higher.",36,en

FTA is good for a country with no nature resources but if FTA agreement will take away jobs and businesses. The agreement have to study carefully. Unfortunately CECA has affected the residents jobs .If other agreement have the same effect .The opposite will also bring out .It is not targeting India national. The economic pie is getting smaller there fore .More afford should be implemented for Singaporean to get those Quality .Companies will always look for cheap and Quality workers to be competitive to bring in customers and jobs to make profit . If wages are a problem .The cost of living will have to go down. The Foreign workers or FT are to supplement the workforce but not to take away jobs and businesses Otherwise the residents have to go oversea in search of jobs.If control foreigners to come in .

"Unlike many FTAs, CECA is so glaring for several reasons. It just shows that if properly managed, CECA is not a problem.  For example:  CECA Professionals benefited from the expertise they bring to Singapore. This poses problem with influx of workers from that country like no other. These issues include:  1. Qualifications: it is widely known that many fake degrees had surfaced from these country to benefit the agreement.  2. Hiring: It is also widely known that Hiring Managers tend to hire the same countrymen. This is not an assumption. Unfortunately, I can’t give statistics. But, you can get your MoM Agencies to run checks in Hiring  processes and loopholes. I have witnessed some of these backdoor practices myself.  3. Communal Dynamics: Because of the sheer professional numbers, those come from CECA Countries tend to have their own communal activities, which is normal. But, their numbers may not spell good to our Singapore core which our forefathers have built for 50 over years to mix with other community.  4. Cultural Dynamics: we know how complicated CECA nation is. It is undeniable that certain Cultural practices (i have to mention the practices on Caste System and its internal issues with other faiths) among themselves will spill to our shore and the fear that they will rocked our unity. This can be dangerous if left uncheck. Take a look at issues around the region and how these groups commented against other faiths with hate, naturally drawn from where they came from.  Unless policies are drawn to tackle these, and perhaps many more, I don’t think it poses issues with Singaporeans. We have accommodated workers and professionals from FTA countries in the past including China, Australia and the US  those around the region. I am sure we can treat the same to CECA.",1,en

For locals who lost their old jobs to EPs this is a hard hit in our own country. Government should really listen and look hard at the facts and sufferings of your own citizens. After all the vote is in our hands for the government every 5 years.  Maybe our government do it for the long term economy of Singapore but locals only want their local education to be on par with these EPs and a stable job like in the 70s.

"Preferred destination for Indians is US. Every year US gives around 250,000 H1B visa and 67% goes to Indians. This is every year. There is fierce competition from FB, Microsoft and others to get as many of this H1B visa and these companies ask for more. That is why US has been innovating. Microsoft, Google and FB have CBP type of environment. But no one complains. How does this small CECA number compare with the US numbers? In addition, many Indian students graduate in the US with specialisation in AI, Machine learning, etc. And top students with the same skill sets move to US. Singapore is not the preferred destination contrary to many Singaporeans think. Google for the number of H1B visa given out every year in the US. And Singapore is given 3,000 H1B1 visa every year as part of the Singapore US FTA. But not more than couple of hundreds taken up by Singaporeans. Singaporeans who lose jobs in hospitality and service industry are not qualified to get these IT jobs unless they have the IT skills or upgrade themselves. Study the investment made by Singapore in India as part of CECA and benefits. India is an opportunity for Singapore companies to expand and diversify. The link between the two countries is historical going back 2,000 years. Singaporeans should show more awareness and understanding on this discussion. By all means, let’s push the Government and make them accountable but emotionally generating negative energy is not productive. We have to stay connected and welcoming.

"KT Koh You have for realise that certain races are strong in certain industries. Do we question how come got many PRCs working in the Chinese restaurants here? Because we know they have the skills to do so.  Likewise for many IT companies and banks, many Indians have the skills and the competency to do those jobs. The CEO for Mastercard and Nasdaq are Indians, along with tech companies like Mircosoft, Google, Adobe, Nokia & IBM have Indian CEOs as well.  When similar companies open their offices here in Singapore, they tend to hire Indians with those skills.  Look at DBS history, S.Dhanbalan was one of their founders in 1968 and served a long time there. I used to work for DBS and we called DBS ""Dhanabalan Banking System"" as a insider joke.  The current CEO for DBS is Piyush Gupta who is an Indian but took up Singapore citizenship. Stuff like this are good examples.  How come no one questions the larger amount of Indians in the construction sector, but they are unhappy about CECA? Singapore has remained a open Economy, but signed a treaty for the CECA which actually limits Indians working as PMETs to a certain number.  It is nothing new for Indians coming to Singapore as bankers since colonial times under the British. Singapore used the Indian rupees as their legal tender in their early days before switching to the dollars. I am a 5G Singaporean..I have worked in the banking sector and IT sector before, like DBS and IBM. It is all skills based, which is why even Indians hold high positions in American companies.",4,en

Actually if you ask me, the Indians are more interested to head to the US, but the competiton is high even there. Our biggest strength is that due to our WiFi signals and 5G network, many tech companies set up their companies here Including Facebook. But they tend to hire more CECA, to manage their systems and networks here. Australia is a resource rich country and can survive on their milk exports alone. But Singapore is not like that.

My grandfather during the British times in 1950s at Paya Lebar Airbase through voluntary NS, which the Chinese community was against it and even had a riot ( do read about the Anti NS riot in Singapore in the 1950s), my father in the 1970s and me during 2000s. During my grandfather's time, there are some Malays in the Airforce. At my time, I only saw 2.  Because a lot things have changed. Singapore's Airforce not only look at Skills, but also towards your loyalty for the nation regardless of what.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think Malays are not loyal to Singapore, in fact they are. But the Airforce and MSD, often does a lot of background checks to see if there is any security threat before Malays are allowed in the Airforce which is why I seen so few. Many of them are against some of our Military Allies, like the US and some other nations or can be pro Malaysia, just like some local Chinese can be so pro China to the extent of wanting to spy for them.  For me I am loyal to Singapore and I am ok with their economy being open. The CECA actually regulates the flow of Indian expats to ensure that they meet the work permit requirements.

The government has bets on getting in cheaper workers in all level of skills can ensure continuous FDI in flow. That's depend on what kind of foreign investment we receive. I supposed the local talents pool should be the determine factor for incoming FDI but consider the size or the appetite of the foreign companies local talent pool of course will restrict their ambition to grow. In reality is like this? Why we don't feel secure? Why we feel our opportunity eroded by inflow of unlimited foreigners into our workforce?,0,en
"Siva Ram I did not question or hv any doubt over certain races have certain skills whether is blue or white collar jobs. I am saying simply why our gov must hv a CECA to facilitate maybe easier passage for Indians to get jobs in Singapore and why not have a fair system to all races and open recruitment based on respective industries own needs? I think u seems abit skew in quoting specific industries but here we are questioning gov as a whole why CECA with Indian gov???? Is CECA very different from all the FTAs that our gov have signed? If not much different why some countries not very keen to sign the FTA? Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian over 30 yrs or more since independent have integrate well and respect each other race and religion esp after the riots in 1950s and racist riots in1960s so in the 1990s when we start to import foreign talents from Causcasian countries and follow by mainland Chinese, we also faced similar frustrations over their behaviours and taking away local jobs but our gov never learn and now start to get from Indian. Are u aware that after the racist riot in 1960s, PM LKY did alot of work that I am now very proud of our Singaporean Malays and I am sure we can see them improving leaps and bounds in many areas? So after LKY era the gov have not done very well or maybe they completely ignore Singaporean concerns and now Chinatown is flooded with all mainland Chinese foods as many local Singaporean Chinese not keen to work as hawker anymore due to cheaper labour coming in! Before this the Caucasian inflow in late 1980s and early 1990s hv made alot of Singaporean richer and better living thus no one want to go into street cleaning, rubbish collecting, construction areas or any hard labour as most want to work within air con. So I hope u appreciate that here we are not debating on why Indians coming but why the CECA agreement specifically for India?",0,en
Stural John Agreed,0,en
"Den Hoff Again the general point is why we sign a CECA agreement with India for import of talent from India. I am ok with any countries so long as the gov dont specifically provide a channel to certain countries. For example during by time in NUS or at that time was called University of Singapore, our gov set a quota I think is 25% places for ASEAN students, no problem with that and within MOE how they assess and recruit honestly nobody knows and no body can question but CECA is broad daylight type of importing foreign talents. Yes gov claimed local Singaporean were choosy but again history will tell u why that is so as I did mentioned if u read my previous comments over Singapore since gaining independent in 1965!

The situation is a bit pressing, with technology jobs in heavy demand across a raft of sectors, with around 6,500 newly-created openings being offered by financial institutions alone. 90% of those roles created this year are permanent positions, says Ravi Menon, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).”",0,en

It was many years back (unfortunately i believe it is still happening now, this CECA or other Workforce foreign PMET jobs policies thing)   I was out of job and went to an interview at a local company. During the interview the HR told me to lower my pay expectation (the thing is I am not even asking for high pay) they offer me a ridiculously low pay. And told me that the salary I asked, they can actually hire foreigners with good university degree at a much lower competitive salary doing the same job scope.   I am a father with young child. I can’t afford to accept such pay. I did not accept the salary they offer me. I actually walked out feeling very depressed and shocked. And was asking myself “what is happening to Singapore ?”.  I can never forget that feeling.  It is totally unprofessional for a HR to tell me this. But at least i know the truth. The truth of how a gov policy can also affect how companies hire as well as how a country develop.  I am not being xenophobic here. I have worked with foreign colleagues. Some are really competent and hardworking. I do welcome foreigners. I do understand that Singapore do not have natural resources and one of the way is having a large effective workforce that can fuel the country’s economic growth. I also understand that Singapore can’t depend on just Singaporean workforce alone to sustain this economy.  But it shouldn’t be coming in by the millions and shouldn’t be just focusing on GDP of the “country” to compete with surrounding countries. Without taking into much consideration into any social impact it will course.  These have been happening in the pass 20 years. The people who are being alert are already voicing out many years ago. But still the ordinary folks believe the incumbent party can work this out, so incumbent have the mandate to push through these policies without much regards.   Some of the key reasons companies choose to set-up business in Singapore is because of stable government, safe environment, well developed infrastructure, knowledgeable workforce (to a certain extend), majority of locals able to communicate in English a universal language used in business and documents and ease of doing business here.  If those companies think it is not so great setting up operations in Singapore and required majority of talents from a certain country or certain countries, then better for them to set up their business in that other country instead.   Because we can’t just let companies pander to all the benefits of a country yet does not bring much social and job creation to the locals of a country that they are operating in.  It just sound sad that the parliament is discussing about Singaporean core and fair treatment of locals.

The trend? 80s was a boom for tech, which was when the Japanese was king, sought to expand and saw Singapore for its cheap labour then, a major reason to set up shop here. The 90s and 00s brought about more ambitious projects like better public housing, real estate like office buildings and major attractions and events like MBS, F1.

Can we say the same about this current generation of leaders? Why why why are cases on the rise so much so that enough noises from the ground have risen to be heard in parliament. Those who are not directly affected should hear directly from those who suffered under the unintended impacts of FTAs like CECA. Instead of boasting self that CECA perfectly fine, govt should reflect if they should improve the implementation and monitoring of all FTAs and fair employment policies so that our locals are not at the losing end.   https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3123929/indias-fake-degrees-hundreds-singapore-malaysia-us-canada-left  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/discrimination-hiring-foreigners-nationality-employers-mom-14329098  This parliamentary session, suddenly govt hides all this data?

Ball is actually on govt’s court now but if they are unwilling to disclose conclusive data, no one should criticised alternative parties for asking relevant questions on behalf of the people they serve, the ones who shared their plights and personal experiences - real people whose lives are negatively impacted by unfair practises brought about by poor FTA monitoring.

"Syarifuddin Azhar Rosli we must acknowledge that there are real cases on the ground in order for PSP to make such queries.  As a govt, it is the duty to assure the people by showing the data. I will stop repeating this point. Tiring lah to keep saying govt needs to acknowledge that PSP is ALSO serving the community by presenting those queries and then govt should disclose key data to address concerns once and for all.   Cos bear in mind, mainstream media (eg ST) and media from other countries have also published about discriminatory employment policies in certain companies, the fake qualifications that caused locals not to be employed and just add this to people’s view in workplaces where a certain nationality is the majority there in quite a few of the companies there - thus the legit queries. What govt failed is to address these concerns sufficiently thus the continued pressing by quite a number of public for full disclosure of such data.   Unfair to simply suggest PSP is unfair with their queries when their role is to help the people affected by it - real people. Makes govt look very petty and unreliable - not trustworthy by hiding key data. ",0,en
Jing Sheng Toh govt mixing it not me lol,0,en
"Lee Harry it is undeniable that ppl are unsatisfied by alot recently, and jobs are hard to come by. personally, ive applied to more than 30 positions and only finally successful in one. My reasons was that I did not have enough experience, or I was just recovering from heart condition so any employers who need physical work will not hire me due to the amount of risk they take.   From my story above, it shows that individual stories from the ground are unique. The PSP takes individual stories from the ground and generalising them to the public is a worrying action. It taps on individual prejudices and biases, and not actually giving an alternative solution to the issues on the ground. Abolishing or reviewing is easy to say, but never easy to execute.   I agree with you that people faking qualifications is a heinous act that should not be tolerated. However, cherry-picking those facts to fit theories about a certain group is not a good move. Instead, the focus should be on companies and govt agencies to improve detection of counterfeit/fake information from anybody.   You mention data and I agree with you that govt are very hesitant about data being shared to the public. Data, without context, will definitely lead to misconstruction or misuse of data by anybody. Thats why they are careful about releasing data, with even Mr Leong Mun Wai from PSP saying in Parliamnet that there is so much data that there is no time to go through every single one of them.  Finally, to collect it all, stories from the ground brought up by PSP are not backed up by data. I hope that as much as we scrutinise data from our govt, we must also be critical of the opposition giving us data about their own findings and surveys. Hope that by this scrutiny of data, they are able to not just be anecdotal but factual in their claims that change has to be made. I would also appreciate if the opposition comes in with a concrete and solid Bill  to enact changes that even the PAP could not resist.

"Lee Harry ive read this before for own knowledge purposes. Nationality is one factor, with other factors like gender, mental health, and disabilities being a few of the other factors determined to be discriminated during the hiring process. News outlets tend to aim for clickbait or attractive titles to get people to read their articles. Thats why when they post on social media, their titles are meant more to appeal rather than being a true summary of the article. It is part of the journalism game and something we readers have to be particular about.   In that, more specificity with what they mean by ""nationality-based"" discrimination. It can mean between Singaporeans and PRs, between foreigners and Singaporeans or even can mean one particular foreign nationality than another. Alot of blurred lines, hopefully cleared up when they release these statistics.    I would say that when in Parliamentary Questions, it is hard to lay down all facts in one go as they have a limited time to respond. This is due to the amount of questions needed to be answered that day, and also the amount of Bills that needed to be introduced or discussed in that day. It would be best to have these questions, that require alot of explanation, to be given as a written reply.

And by saying those folks from CECA can perform better than us, you are telling the world they came from a much more superior education system as compared to ours. As a Singaporean, I feel very belittle by such stand from our leaders.

"Can parliamentary debates on any topic of discussions be targeted at the said topic alone, without targeting the persons or party? Or, worse, without having to play the Race card so easily every now and then? Or, without someone who keeps questioning you, "" Are you racist?"", just for bringing up a topic for debate/ discussion?  That will only serve to cause more distractions away from the real issue at hand, and create more divide and insecurity in our society, between the different ethnic groups. It becomes divisive, instead of unifying.  I am not sure whether I should share this. But this was what happened today.  I was exiting a commercial building, after work, through one of the designated exits. The commercial building only has one designated entrance, for visitors and staff to check-in via their TraceTogether apps/ tokens. I think this is quite common nowadays.  But as I exited the automatic ( exit only) glass door, another gentleman who was standing outside ( seemingly on the phone), took the opportunity to sneak into the building through the same glass door, as I exited. The building security  staff and safe distancing ambassadors were nowhere in sight. At that moment, I felt like telling him to use the designated entrance further down, instead.  But I didn't do that. Because he is from a different ethnic group than me.  Looking at how the race card has been so easily played nowadays online and in parliament, I was not sure if by correcting him, I might be misunderstood for being a racist, and be subjected to online judgment. Or, worse, police questioning, because of some uploaded video footage ( on social media) that would likely go viral.  Having enough problems of my own, I decided to mind my own business. I was like, ""Heck, let the government handle this lah. I don't care already"". Because of what I have consistently read in the news. So, if you are the leaders of this tiny nation, please be more mindful, and resist the temptation to play the Race card so easily. It's divisive, counter-productive and has consequences. Thank you.",0,en

"""Long-term temporary entry""? Sounds like an oxymoron? It is. The government's narrative is problematic. Please read article 9.5 below. Put simply, unless it's a national security concern, intra-corporate transferees can be for up to 8 years. They term it as ""long-term temporary entry"". This is part of the agreement. The govt is saying we are not obliged to take them ""permanently"" yet doesn't acknowledge that 8 years is a long time in the corporate world and hardly ""temporary"". It's a definition that doesn't fit reality, you might as well say your hdb is ""long-term temporary"". Ask yourselves, does your boss tell you ""Eh, meng, this is my 8-year plan for you"". Also, there's nothing to stop them applying for ep or pr during such time, it may not be approved but there's nothing to stop them doing so and extending their stay beyond 8 years. It's a shame PSP didn't push this point more, it's a clear weakness in the government's narrative and argument and the govt knows it   ARTICLE 9.5: LONG-TERM TEMPORARY ENTRY Intra-Corporate Transferees 1. Unless there has been a breach of any of the conditions governing temporary entry, or an application for an extension of an immigration visa has been refused on such grounds of national security or public order by the granting Party as it deems fit, each Party shall grant temporary entry to an intra-corporate transferee of the other Party, who otherwise meets its criteria for the grant of an immigration visa, for an initial period of up to two years or the period of the contract, whichever is less.

It was ok until people start to hire from their own group. It is inevitable because of group mentality. There are many ways to go around ‘hire a local first' rule.

On 29 June 2005, India and Singapore signed the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA). This free trade agreement not only enables Singapore and India to trade goods freely, it also allows professionals to work in each other country more easily. The CECA was concluded after 13 rounds of negotiation and the Singapore’s side was led by none other than Heng Swee Keat, the current PM-in-waiting, who was then Permanent Secretary for Trade and Industry. Heng and his team essentially did the ground work together with their Indian counterparts. They then presented their proposals to the politicians for approval. Some of the areas covered by CECA include: Improved Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement, Trade in Goods, Customs, Investment, Trade in Services, Intellectual Property, etc. However, controversial ones include concluding further Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) so as to facilitate the freer movement of professionals between Singapore and India. It helps to recognise each other’s education and professional qualifications so that Indian and Singaporean professionals from the following five professions could be able to practise in each other country: Accounting and auditing Architecture Medical (doctors) Dental Nursing Already, Singapore now recognises degrees of Indian doctors and nurses from certain Indian universities. Movement of Natural Persons Then, CECA also enables movement of persons between both countries. In particular, professionals employed in 127 specific occupations will be allowed entry and stay for up to 1 year or the duration of contract, whichever is less. Also, intra-corporate transferees (i.e. managers, executives and specialists within organisations) will be permitted to stay and work in India and Singapore for an initial period of up to 2 years or the period of the contract, whichever is less. The period of stay may be extended for period of up to 3 years at a time for a total term not exceeding 8 years. In theory, of course, CECA could also benefit Singaporean professionals wanting to work in India but how many Singaporeans really want to work there to earn in rupees? Indian companies try to exploit CECA loophole After CECA was signed, some of the Indian IT companies set-up in Singapore tried to exploit the “intra-corporate transferee” loophole so as to get more Indian IT workers to work here. They would hire them in India and then “transfer” them to their Singapore subsidiaries to work, without the need to hire any Singaporeans. India unhappy with Singapore By 2017, thanks to CECA, large number of Indian professionals especially those in IT sector were moved into Singapore as “intra-corporate transferees”, since CECA did not set any quotas. Few Singaporeans, if any, were hired. Many Singaporean PMETs started filing complaints of discrimination to the Manpower Ministry through the Fair Consideration Framework. The Singapore government was forced to slow down the approvals of Indian professionals to work here. “This (visa problem) has been lingering for a while but since early-2016, visas are down to a trickle. All Indian companies have received communication on fair consideration, which basically means hiring local people,” the president of Nasscom, the IT association of India, complained. In retaliation, the Indian government decided against expanding the scope of goods where import duties for Singapore goods would be cut unless the concerns of Indian industry are addressed, the Times of India reported. In particular, the Indian government is against Singapore using the “fair consideration framework” to regulate the employment of Indian professionals in Singapore. “They (Singapore) are doing it despite the CECA clearly stating that there will be no ENT (economic needs test) or quotas on agreed services. This is a violation of the agreement,” warned an Indian official. Obviously, when Heng negotiated CECA with India prior to 2005, he had not foreseen all these issues facing Singaporean PMETs. Perhaps he cared more if GIC and Temasek could invest freely in India or if DBS could open more branches there? Nevertheless, Heng was confirmed to be appointed DPM of Singapore on May Day. Opposition member Lim Tean has this to say to Heng, the current PM-in-waiting, “Heng Swee Keat should explain his role in CECA, which cost Singaporeans jobs! What is the benefit to Singapore of CECA?”",2,en

"Brian Tan Ok, here's what I heard and is very probable with regards to ""short term service suppliers"" problem to Singapore.  There are government contracts won by foreign MNCs which deploy personnel to long term contracts using this clause. However, imagine having a switch of personnel every 3 months for multi-year contract. Would it be an excellent customer experience or frustrating experience of having to re-explain to different contractor personnel throughout the whole contractual period?  The criticism can fall on the customer for choosing the foreign MNC. However, due to government tendering processes, the cheapest bidder will almost always get the tender once they are shortlisted. There will be one department which prefers to choose a higher quality local contractor who knows the domain and local landscape of what Singaporean citizens want but there will always be another department that is watching on budget and making sure the high quality contractor doesn't get the contract because that's his KPI.  Again, this is what I heard about ""short term service suppliers"". Does it cause job losses to Singaporeans? Perhaps others can shed some light.  Perhaps the high level trade numbers don't tell the situation happening on the ground.  Or perhaps trade numbers are all that matters........  Ramesh was just the trigger or butterfly effect on everything else that happened thereafter.  It will be interesting to hear Ramesh position on this since he is now a Singaporean.",0,en

"https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ftas-have-created-more-jobs-for-sporeans-chan  This CCS is spewing rubbish through his mouth to mislead and confuse.    Here is the fact, using his own argument.    Since 2005, there have been 268,000 new citizens and 584,000 new PRs. Total 852K.  We all know the government doesn't take in blue-collar types being given citizenship and PR. So all these 852K foeign intakes are all PMETs.  CCS also said there are now 1.25M PMETs versus 825K in 2005.  So, thats an incremental 398k jobs (1.25m now less 852k in 2005) .    398K new jobs PMET jobs since 2005, versus an intake of 852K new citizens and PRs who are PMETs since 2005.  Net net, shortage of 454K jobs (852K - 398K) difference between new jobs created and new PMETS imported .   So clearly the PMETs jobs created is lesser than the PR/New Citizens taken in and since all new citizens and PRs have jobs, it must mean that 454K jobs are taken away form Singaporeans.     Simple maths.  simple logic.  Clearl conclusion Singaporeans are worst off.   ---- Quote  """"Addressing claims that Ceca helped Indian nationals steal jobs from Singaporeans, Mr Chan cited figures to show that the number of higher-skilled jobs for Singaporeans grew by 400,000 since Ceca was signed in 2005.  The proportion of Singaporeans in such jobs has also gone up from 50 per cent to 56.8 per cent.  In 2005, of the 1.65 million Singaporeans and permanent residents in the workforce, 825,000 of them were professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).  There are now 2.2 million in the resident workforce, of whom 1.25 million are in PMET jobs. """"",0,en

I do have personal experience in this with 2 of the top tech companies operating in Singapore as APAC HQ. If you read this article, this is sufficiently informing you that CECA doesn’t open a flow gate for foreigners (definitely not PR and citizenship status). The “fair consideration framework” in place is not something you can manipulate easily! I have seen multiple times that a role is not filled for “months” because you can’t get the right candidate, especially for a newly created specialised role that got transferred to Singapore.  The gov is making sure the workforce (including you and I) is educated and re-developed with updated knowledge and skills but there are situations where maybe the best person to lead the newly transferred/created function is going to be a highly qualified/experienced foreigner (but still have to operate under fair consideration framework). At this point, please realise that under the same framework, local talents are considered for the team member level roles too!  So what if i have to report to a foreigner when I’m not as qualified & experienced? This is my opportunity to learn and grow and honestly, this is the same for everyone else who seized this opportunity.  On the other hand, we should be happy that new jobs are being created in Singapore for all of us.

"My Personal Opinion:  1) Short courses like WSQ (apart from mandatory modules for jobs like cleaning, security, safety, training and etc) does not help to find job as Employee because lack of proper qualification.  2) Short course only good if you want to top up current practice and new skills in your industry or you need this new knowledge to provide your services as Trainer/Consultant. Mostly its benefits Freelancers rather than Employees.  3) Singaporeans are educated people and once they are out of ‘Employee’ status, they will mostly end up becoming a Trainer/Consultant as a Freelancer or Boss. If Government don’t focus on creating jobs indirectly in Training Industry, there will be more social unrest in Singapore.  4) According to how our statistics work, you do not consider as ‘Unemployed’ if you study full time studies which most ATOs’ courses break into day and night classes but never full and part time classes.  5a) Singapore have 3 levels which is ITE Certificate, Polytechnic Diploma and University Degree while other countries have only 2 levels which is Non-Graduate (Certificate and Diploma) and Graduate (Degree).  5b) ITE train Graduates to do blue collar positions like Admin Assistant and Technician. ITE Graduates consider ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’. On another hand, we have Foreigners like Malaysians holding SPM (equivalent to our GCE O) who are ‘Untrained’. But Singapore Employers prefer to hire Malaysians for blue collar positions because they are more ‘committed to work’ like working OT with or without OT pay and their basic wages is lower than Singaporeans.  5c) In this case, ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’ is no longer a concern to Singapore Employers because they can always provide OJT to them at workplace.  -----------  My Complaint about Singapore Public Education:  6a) Singapore is top 1st or 2nd in the world for Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) while our neighbour, Malaysia, is 400+ ranking for PISA. Is there a need for Singapore Government to raise the education standard that increase unnecessary stress that lead to suicide?  6b) Most of the world like Malaysia only have 1 main stream which will allow Secondary School Graduates to be ‘Year 10 Standard’ competency. With SPM, Malaysians can used it to enter our Polytechnic in Singapore at the age of 18 year old because their Secondary School education is a 5 years programme (from 13 to 17 year old). Our GCE O Graduates from Express stream enter Polytechnic at the age of 17 year old.  6c) On another hand, Singapore Government created many streams to prevent Singaporeans from getting higher education. I will used Normal Technical (NT) stream as an example.  6d) Our NT GCE N Graduates are force to enter ITE for Nitec (2 years programme from 17 to 18 year old) and follow by Higher Nitec (2 years programme from 19 to 20 year old) before they enter Polytechnic at the age of 21 year old. This is provided NT GCE N Graduates with ITE qualification (Nitec / Higher Nitec) are able to get a good Grade Point Average (GPA) to secure a place for higher education (Higher Nitec / Polytechnic Diploma) or else they are force to enter workforce at a young age. I did not even include the time for National Services (NS) and Time Wasted on waiting to enlist and higher education school reopen.  6e) So why can’t Singapore Government allow NT GCE N Graduates to study directly for Diploma at ITE or Polytechnic instead of wasting time and effort on Certificate (Nitec and Higher Nitec) level?  6f) Some may say NT GCE N Graduates are stupid which is the reason why Certificate (Nitec and Higher Nitec) level needs to be created for them. This is not true. According to Worker Improvement through Secondary Education (WISE) programme conducted by ITE, NT GCE N is equal to Normal Academic (NA) Secondary 2 level which at best consider at ‘Year 8 Standard’ in the world. Singapore Government short-change NT GCE N Graduates in general education which they are 3 years shy away from competent to take GCE O exams. This is the reason why ITE Graduates with NT GCE N will have a hard time in higher education like Polytechnic that lead to barely pass or even fail from programme.  6g) So why do Singapore Government want to shortchange Singaporeans in term of general education?  -----------  In My Conclusion:  7) When it comes to Training/Education, Singapore Government will incorporate with their political ideology.  8 ) Singapore Government never consider Training/Education is important to Singaporeans and only wayang by appearing to support Training/Education Movement to Singaporeans.  9) For example, Singapore needs Foreigners as Specialised Domain Experts (SDE) because Singaporeans do not have that competency. But did Singapore Government step in to ensure the SDE skills and knowledges are pass down to Singaporeans? The answer is no which is the reason why Singapore forever needs to rely on Foreigners.  10) Another example will be my point 5b, do Singapore Government step up to enforce Employers to hire candidates for positions like Technician must be a ‘Certified’ and ‘Trained’ person? The answer is no which is the reason why Singaporeans will lose their competitive compare to Foreigners which Training will never make up for the lost.",10,en

"*Thai specialist: Sinovac can provide up to 99.4% immunity*  😊 BANGKOK (The Nation/ANN):  The Sinovac vaccine provides as much as “99.4 per cent immunity against Covid-19 a month after the second dose”, Chulalongkorn University virology specialist and chief of the Centre of Excellence in Clinical Virology Dr Yong Poovorawan said in a Facebook post on Thursday (April 22).  He was citing a study on immunity by the centre and Banphaeo General Hospital in Samut Sakhon.  Researchers studied the immunity of people before and after they received two doses of the Chinese vaccine, administered three weeks apart.  “We found that a person’s immunity greatly increased on receiving the vaccine. A month after the second jab, immunity then increased, similar to immunity in patients who had already been infected for 4-8 weeks, ” he explained.  The Sinovac vaccine provides as much as “99.4 per cent immunity against Covid-19 a month after the second dose”, Chulalongkorn University virology specialist and chief of the Centre of Excellence in Clinical Virology Dr Yong Poovorawan said in a Facebook post on Thursday.  “People who received the *vaccine have 99.4 per cent immunity against the Covid-19 spike protein,* while it was 92.5 per cent for patients who had already been infected, ” he said.  Yong said the centre is conducting a long-term study on immunity in a bid to predict the chance of Covid-19 infections.  “We already know that patients who have been cured can be infected by Covid-19 again, but the severity is likely to be less severe than the first time, ” he said.  “In the long term, this study will tell us whether it is necessary to administer a third Covid-19 jab and if so then when should it be administered, ” he added. - The Nation/Asia News Network  https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2021/04/22/thai-specialist-sinovac-can-provide-up-to-994-immunity#.YIFAxyh4ivB.whatsapp",0,en

"Jim Lion Hindsight Larry is incapable of answering such questions and is blowing smoke.  He spoke about salaries in the 1990s, and how FTs have come here and Sg salaries have now reached $4.5k.  Salaries are dependant on demand and supply and also on inflation.  Hindsight Larry doesn't even understand Economics 101 and yet holds the position of Minister for Finance, and this is scary.  Larry fails to explain why many private sector salaries lag behind civil service salaries.  By the way life in the 1990s was so much better.  An excerpt from CNA :  Mr Wong said that those who want to see fewer foreign work pass holders may be feeling “a sense of nostalgia about how things were like in the past”.  While there were fewer foreign PMETs in Singapore in the 1990s, overall standards of living were also much lower then and median salaries were less than S$2,000 compared to about S$4,500 today, he said.  “Is that what we want? Stagnate in the 1990s, while the rest of the world progresses around us?” he asked.",3,en

"My very own experience, I encountered it myself. Not only middle or high management affected. Even those junior/senior executive level also affected.   It was many years back (unfortunately i believe it is still happening now, this CECA or other Workforce foreign PMET jobs policies thing)   I was out of job and went to an interview at a local company. During the interview the HR told me to lower my pay expectation (the thing is I am not even asking for high pay) they offer me a ridiculously low pay. And told me that the salary I asked, they can actually hire foreigners with good university degree at a much lower competitive salary doing the same job scope.   I am a father with young child. I can’t afford to accept such pay. I did not accept the salary they offer me. I actually walked out feeling very depressed and shocked. And was asking myself “what is happening to Singapore ?”.  I can never forget that feeling.  It is totally unprofessional for a HR to tell me this. But at least i know the truth. The truth of how a gov policy can also affect how companies hire as well as how a country develop.  I am not being xenophobic here. I have worked with foreign colleagues. Some are really competent and hardworking. I do welcome foreigners. I do understand that Singapore do not have natural resources and one of the way is having a large effective workforce that can fuel the country’s economic growth. I also understand that Singapore can’t depend on just Singaporean workforce alone to sustain this economy.  But it shouldn’t be coming in by the millions and shouldn’t be just focusing on GDP of the “country” to compete with surrounding countries. Without taking into much consideration into any social impact it will course.  These have been happening in the pass 20 years. The people who are being alert are already voicing out many years ago. But still the ordinary folks believe the incumbent party can work this out, so incumbent have the mandate to push through these policies without much regards.   Some of the key reasons companies choose to set-up business in Singapore is because of stable government, safe environment, well developed infrastructure, knowledgeable workforce (to a certain extend), majority of locals able to communicate in English a universal language used in business and documents and ease of doing business here.  If those companies think it is not so great setting up operations in Singapore and required majority of talents from a certain country or certain countries, then better for them to set up their business in that other country instead.   Because we can’t just let companies pander to all the benefits of a country yet does not bring much social and job creation to the locals of a country that they are operating in.  It just sound sad that the parliament is discussing about Singaporean core and fair treatment of locals.   I see other countries implement policies to protect its own citizens or even protect the current population. But in Singapore ... haiz.  Now giving the same or similar promise again ? .",310,en

"BTW, isolated incidents due to the misbehaviour of a couple of individuals do not make the whole nation racist per se....  People need to firstly understand what racism actually is ....   Racism is systemic, prolonged and targeted at selected people/groups; and racism is also in the eyes of the beholder. Sure there are casual and indirect racism whether intentional or unintentional, direct racism and systemic racism etc and the underlying issues are power imbalances or perceived power imbalances or discriminatory policies/behaviour or economic imbalances or stereotyping or due to historical events etc ..  Really, there's racism and discrimination within the same race too ...eg Chinese from one area being ""racist and discriminatory"" against Chinese from other areas, other economic groups etc; Indians from one area being ""racist and discriminatory"" against Indians from other areas, other caste groups etc, etc ...  Ever wondered why Asians can crack certain jokes about themselves and not be thought racist, why indigenous people can use certain words among themselves and not be seen as racist, why friends can use certain words among themselves and not be thought offensive, but once the same jokes or words are used by people of other races or strangers etc, it becomes racist or offensive ....WHY?   In that respect, individual tolerance and understanding, personal responsibility and government/institutional responsibility are required to tackle true racial and other behavioural issues and to tackle the underlying issues causing such misbehaviour ....  And the inconvenient truth is that tackling the underlying issues and not exacerbating them to create self inflicted disharmony is the key ....so the CECA favouring a particular nation over others, the engineered discriminatory reserved PE to parachute in the preferred candidate which also massacred the core values of our National Pledge aren't helpful and can serve to exacerbate the issue, to allow racial disharmony to set in and has also ""aggravated the sense of xenophobia among a certain group of our people""....  Really, we need to ensure that the racist card, the mental card, the gender card etc are only used when warranted and not just to point score or to suit individual agendas etc .....

In 2010 onwards, the data showed the Indians group having above average growth, and has overtaken the Chinese household incomes. Question is what else if not CECA that has caused this. CECA is very specific to certain racial group i.e. Indians. It was signed in 2005. 2020 consensus is even more telling as the growth rate is even greater. So if CECA did not cause this, and failed immigration policies, I do not know what else did. Anyone has any explanation to this?",12,en

"Quote: ""Unhappiness towards Indian immigrants in Singapore is fuelled largely by false allegations made by alternative party Progress Singapore Party (PSP) on how the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) has allowed Indian professionals to come here easily for work, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in a Facebook post on Thursday (1 July)."" --- This is a very serious allegation, all the more so when it is made by a minister.  Imagine that it was an opposition member that make a similar allegation against a PAP minister.  The minister will huff and puff and demand no less for an apology and a withdrawal of the allegation.  I think it behooves the minister to substantiate his allegation with proper evidence.  😁😁  I have always wondered whether a non-adversarial form of democracy is achievable or not, but with ministers behaving like Ong, it is certainly impossible.  But I guess PAP ministers have to behave in an adversarial manner since they hold that democracy is necessary adversarial.  😁😁",0,en

"8/30/2020 The Silly Logic Of Singapore's Employment Strategy  Let it be very clear in our head:  1. No sovereign and sensible country in the world would allow foreigners to invade its territory in any form, any way, any how.  2. No intelligent and wise government worth its salt would allow foreign job hunters to come into the country to dominate and overwhelm its tiny job market.  3. No caring and patriotic leader would allow foreigners to steal and rob in broad daylight the rice-bowls (their only means of livelihood) of his own countrymen.  4. No decent brain would think of providing an avenue for the influx of alien 'talents' from a third world country (that has more than one billion mouths to feed) to infiltrate,  and imbalance the employment equilibrium within its beloved country and jeopardise the livelihood and survival of its own citizens.  Now, take a closer and deeper look into the employment strategy of Singapore. What do you think it is? It is at the very least, silly.  Recently, the Chief of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ravi Menon openly stated, and therefore confirmed that 57% of senior management from the banking sector are foreign employees.  The 57% is a good indication that the banking industry clearly prefers foreigners than Singaporeans. How has the employment situation in this lucrative sector stealthily crept up to this unhealthy state? Someone must be sleeping.  Are Singaporeans really less educated, less well-trained, less qualified, less intelligent and therefore less competitive? Are our universities producing misfit and unfit graduates that can't even compete with third world  nicely printed papers from Degree Mills?  In the past 15 years, since CECA was signed to secure a steady supply of the very hungry from India, the government had openly, earnestly and relentlessly discouraged Singaporeans from pursuing a degree. Many Junior Colleges have been deliberately closed down.  Recently retired Minister Khaw Boon Wan proudly and crudely said,  “You own a degree, but so what? You can’t eat it. If that cannot give you a good life, a good job, it is meaningless. Can you have a whole country where 100 percent are graduates? I am not so sure ... What you do not want is to create huge graduate unemployment.” (Straits Times; 18 May 2013).  Yes, no smart government would want a 100% graduate population. It would be very difficult for the government to cater jobs for all of them. Moreover, there would be too many smart thinking and analytical people to scrutinise the competency and quality of the leadership in government. This is understandable.  We have always thought that too many graduates in Singapore is not a good thing. But now we learn that 57% of senior bankers are foreign 'talents‘. The question is: How many of this 57% are graduates?  Can we take it that EP holders are mostly graduates? If so, then why does the government keep discouraging us from pursuing a degree and yet allow jobs that require degree holders to go to foreigners with degrees?  I simply can't imagine that a self-proclaimed ""caring and outstanding"" government can purposely weaken its own workforce by discouraging the citizens from attaining higher education (a basic degree) which would definitely enable them to compete on equal footing in a global economy.  ""Go for mastery of skills, said Tharman (Business Times, 18 Sep 2014). And what else did the other Ministers, such as the Trade and Industry Minister and the NTUC Chief (who has been kicked out by the voters in the last GE), said? They said similar things.  Our Universities have been boasting to the world how good they are, even claiming to be Top 10 in Asia, yet these very same Universities cannot even produce top-notch PMETs, such as IT professionals and Bankers? Shameful? Of course!  Think:  Is there any other silly government in the world that purposely weakens it’s own workforce and then bring in foreigners to occupy the lucrative top jobs?

[5]  CECA allows for the movement of four types of business people between Singapore and India. The second review of CECA was concluded with no change to the chapter on movement of people. [6]  In response to claims that surfaced in early 2016 that Singapore had backtracked on its commitment on CECA by blocking Indian IT professionals seeking work visas, and that India had put on hold further liberation of trade in response, [7] a spokesman from India’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that India had not put the CECA on hold and it continued (to be) in force. Singapore also said it had not received any official notification from the Indian government that the review of the CECA had been put on hold. [8]  In September 2018, India and Singapore formally launched the third review of CECA which focuses on trade facilitation, e-commerce and customs. [9]  All of the Free Trade Agreements Singapore has signed are available at Enterprise Singapore's website [10]",2,en

"Singaporeans have to decide between 2 policy lines.  1. No FTs or even reduced Ceca engagement; or 2. Embrace and make the best of it.   In my view 1) is out because to do so is to discourage investment or FDI in Singapore.  As of now the issue is how to embrace and yet create a conducive environment for everyone. It is without doubt that India and China have population thousands of times bigger than us.  It is a fact many of our large companies are Americans and Europeans be it banks, bio-tech and others... and the US-China trade war isn’t helpful.    India provides a huge resource because they are English speaking and very convincing to these companies and geo political environment, in case the politically inapt are not aware.  Yet these companies trust Singapore’s integrity, but we don’t have enough manpower. Companies only employs the best regardless of national borders... even though unfortunately it is also who plays ball with who in the village. That’s human relationships and networking.  So lacking the connection and social relations with Indian national FTs or any national expats will become a natural disadvantage for Singaporeans. Other than the self driven getting themselves network, government agencies and NTUC should engage more to creat these spaces for expat- local to network.  So 2) has to be further enhanced. Importantly more has to be done to benefit locals as we have more FT among us.  More engagement between the expats and locals have to be enhanced.    Locally we have to change ourselves to engage and not think our system of education is the best. We have to acknowledge that our world is global and not local per se.   With thousand apologies, our education only produces government officials, doctors, lawyers and doesn’t teach us how to survive nor relate with foreigners in a globalised world. Yes we so send kids to do overseas internship but it is far and few.  Engage we will grow, disengage we will fail.   More effort to enhance engagement is urgently needed.",0,en

"They Say CECA Is Of Great Benefit To Singapore When More Than Half Of The Residents In Singapore Are Worried About Their Job Security, Career Prospects And Children’s Future!   The IPS study is pretty damning of the PAP isn’t it? Basically it tells you that the majority of Singaporeans have no confidence in the ability of the PAP government to deliver a better life and future for them and their next generation. It also tells you that the so-called 4G Ministers are a total washout and a complete failure, who command little respect from the Singapore citizens.   Against this backdrop,Ong Ye Kung wants to persuade Singaporeans that CECA is good for our Nation. He really is living in fantasy land! Maybe he thinks highly of CECA since he was one of the trade negotiators. And I must also add that Heng Swee Keat was the leader of the negotiating team.   How can there be a place for a lopsided treaty which which allows hundreds of thousands of foreign Indians to come to Singapore to work in good-paying jobs, many of which can be done by Singaporeans, when the majority of Singaporeans are worried about job security, career prospects and their next generation’s future????",0,en

"Irene Goh, monies were lost in China. Shouldn't they have been more careful?   They opened up Singapore in order to invest in India. But why does Sg need Indian doctors, town planners, tax practioners, architects etc? We don't have our own?   If you look at the list of occupations Indian nationals can take up in Sg, they could fill jobs in almost every Ministry in Sg.   Opening up job opportunities in Sg is one thing but why open up P.R. and citizenship?   It all started with dwindling birth rates. So have to import. 1st HK n China, then race proportions became an issue. So have to invite Indians too. So some of the problems are inevitable.   But what created the current discontent with employment and immigration is loss of control. They did not control early on.  There is a lack of co-ordination between the policy makers and those who carry out the policy. Eg the China tour guide case. The guy put in more than a hundred documents in support of his application for residency. Not one was found to be a fake. It took the rich widow's niece to start private civil litigation for ICA to realise they had been duped! Bcos the people who have to put the policy into action don't know what the heck they're doing and/or so minded with filling quotas they did not do the due diligence.   This is where Sg went wrong. Due diligence. We failed at due diligence. So the start point at rectification is to go back to the drawing board, see where we went wrong and set what can be set right. Due diligence is imperative.   If I failed at due diligence and my client suffers a loss, I can be taken before a Law Society Inquiry Panel and sued upside down for reparations.   And what happened when monies were lost in China and now in India? No accountibility. No one has to compensate the losses!   Odd isn't it, doctors, lawyers, architects etc have to compensate their clients when they fail at their jobs and cause losses to their clients but those in higher office appear not to have these obligations?

The history of Indians - we've always travelled to wherever to earn a livelihood. I hope you noticed I used ""livelihood"", not income. It's in our psyche. It has been drummed in via our literature, life principles etc.   Secondly, the finer the quality of the product, the smaller the quantity. Mass produced goods lack that fine craftsmanship.   That's why a country of 1 billion is willing to trade with a country of several millions. The quality of the several millions surpasses the quality of the billion.   A billion it may be but how many of that billion is actively in production mode and how many stuck in the warehouse waiting for a buyer? That's why the billion is willing to trade with the millions.

I am sure when decisions are made, the aim is never for the intension to harm, however every decisions also carries its own risks, thus we needs to calibrate each decisions carefully and review them again every period of time. As for monies lost, yes, we should have been more careful but there is also monies gain, if not, SG will not be able to gives out so much handouts to support Singaporeans during this COVID times and still have its reserves. There is always pro and cons on all things we do. Let’s hope that with everyone’s contributions, we can move Singapore forward is a amiable and peaceful way. Have a great day ahead. 🌈",0,en

"Irene Goh ""calibrate"" is the right word.   The reserves that were drawn - we are expected to put it back whether by increasing gst, other taxes etc. The 1st step has already been implemented - the revision in erp rates.   If the withdrawal for the covid relief packages is to be reimbursed, what about the losses in failed investments? Is there no accountibility? China, Australia and now India.   It's not one investment in 10 that failed. It appears everytime they invest, it's a loss. One of the latest is in the State of Karnataka. Sg invested by agreeing to develop and had already sunk in monies. There was a change in the govt and the new govt said, sorry but it isn't continuing with the old govt's project. This is at the govt level.   At private entity's level, we invested in Bharti Airtel, if I am not wrong. The Ambani conglomerate came out with a new package that is aimed at wiping out the other players. Sg cannot compete with Ambani. That guy has amassed enough to never ever earn for a few 10s of generations more. He can offer at zero cost. Sg did not expect the Ambani group to come out with the new plan. This is but 1 eg of how we failed to assess before stepping into the ring and the rule of the game before you step into the ring: assess your opponent. Know both his and your strengths and weaknesses. Sg failed to do that.   It all comes down to one thing: we are unlike our older generation. We are not as hardy or street smart as our grandparents. We are soft compared to them. Likewise the current leaders compared to the old guard. This is the basic difference between the older generation n us. We don't have their skillset. It's all book knowledge. And bcos of that we have to be more careful. All these current chaps don't realise that. They set their own million dollar salary and think that is their going rate, that is how valuable their skills are. This is what has led to a plethora of problems in Sg.   Unless and until they wake up their ideas and start rectifying their mistakes, instead of adding to their mistakes, Sg will continue to suffer.  When what's his name said that a family of 4 can live on $1000 a month, it's their way of telling us they think we are no better than goats and can be led by our horns. It's not what they say that is insulting to our intelligence but the thought that we are stupid enough to buy everything they say, that is what is insulting to our intelligence.

"Nigel Lim, but where are the jobs created for Singaporeans?   The issue with CECA is not that it has brought Indians in but that it has forced employed Singaporeans out and put Indians in.   Secondly, CECA is a trade agreement. It appears it has become *the* path to Indians nationals emigrating to Sg. Why? How did this happen?",0,en
"Everyone, the problem brought on by CECA is this: Sg wanted in invest in India and in return allowed their companies and nationals to come in. But Sg didn't assess the viability of the companies, commodities and projects before investing and ended up burning its fingers.  Back in the country, CECA has become the pathway for Indian nationals to emigrate to Sg. That is not what CECA was inked for. They come, they earn, they return to their country. Why did that narrative change?   Then the issue of control - too many work passes of various categories issued. Bcos Sg didn't want to risk one person working and unable to support his family, it allowed for dependents ie the wives to work but without levies etc. So the pressure on employment is doubled by the entry of 1 person under CECA.   Thirdly, are you telling me there are no comparably suitable Singaporeans for the job? Only Indians are suitable such that there is a mini-India in so many companies?   Ok, so, we have all these issues cropping up bcos we wanted to invest in India and signed the CECA. So where are the returns on the investments in India? As of now, it appears it's all losses!   All of us can do basic maths right? What's 100 minus 200? That is Sg's situation now.  We have been taken for a royal ride by the Indians! Guys, see it for what it is.

Do we know the details that those foreign executives know? Bcos Singaporeans were told it's not necessary to let us know. Bcos if we knew, the fear is that we'll ask for more.

"Sharing an article written by a pure blue Singaporean:  ”CECA is on the minds of many these few months. It is often articulated by people in-charge that Singapore needs to bring in FT to either create jobs or to transfer skills. There are people who even said that without them, Singapore would lose its competitiveness.  I have been in the education industry for more than 30 years. In my line of work, visiting various universities in the region was a huge part of my job.   30 years ago, there were many foreign lecturers from UK, US, Taiwan, India and  others. Those days indeed , there were areas whereby only expats lecturers were doing a better job than those local ones and indeed it was a transfer of knowledge and experiences from lecturers to students, from Professors to Interns, internships in MNCs.  I just came across a ranking of universities by ` The QS World University Ranking ' :- ( you can actually goodle this )  1.  MIT, USA 2.  Stanford, USA 3.  Harvard , USA 4.  California Inst of Tech, USA 5.  Oxford, UK 6.  ETH Zurich, Switzerland 7.  Cambridge, UK 8.  Imperial College of London, UK 9.  Uni of Chicago, USA 10. UCL , UK 11.  NUS, Singapore 12.  Princeton, USA 13.  NTU, Singapore 15.  Tsinghua, China 22. Uni of Hong Kong 23.  Peking U, China 24.  Tokyo U 59. Uni Malaya 187. Indian Institute of Science, India 193. Indian Institute of Technology Delhi , India 275 Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Indian Models  NUS is ranked 11th NTU is ranked 13th The highest ranking for a Indian University is ranked 187.  Questions on my mind 1.  How did the `Changi Business Park' became ` Chenai Business Park'. 2.  Is it really true that these people were having some kind of skills that Singaporeans did not have or did not manage to acquired at NUS or NTU or other prestigious universities that they graduated from. 3.  How did it happen over he last 15 years, if the so called FTs were granted to work in Singapore, to teach those NUS and NTU graduates, managed to become either PR or citizens, and not only that, their entire family is also in Singapore ! 4.  Over the past 20 years or there about, our MOE's educational system is considered one of the Best in the world. We have always been consistently rank at the top of the OECD's programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ..... and yet, Today the people in charge are telling Singaporeans that we are NOT good enough, that we need these FTs to be sitting on top of us or in many cases, the locals, the true blue Singaporean losing his job to someone riding on CECA, a kind of a passport endorsed by someone in white.  I am not against any country, I am not racist, I am not zenophobic, but I need the government to be accountable for this legal CECA arrangement.  As Dr Tan C B said, ` we need to know how many Singapore companies went to India, how many Singaporean family went to india and same, how many Indian PMET came and became either  PR or citizens and how many of their family members also came and became either PR or citizen.  I am looking at these from the academic point of view with no hatred as I am not affected by this CECA arrangement.  After 15 years of this arrangement, ending with so many FTs here, this does not square well with what i read in the straits times over the last 30 years that our MOE is tops, our NUS and NTU is tops and also our polys and ITEs were doing a fantastic job !  Just sharing because the ranking is irritating me so much , I just wonder who has been lying or CECA in totality has nothing to do with any academic institutions nor rankings. It might just be a cheaper economic decision as Singaporeans are no longer that hungry .....just maybe ......”  ARE SINGAPOREANS REALLY USELESS AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO NURTURE  EXCELLENT TALENTS?

" We have to see the debate in perspective and be objective to see if Singaporeans’ interests are served well for short term and most importantly long term.   1/ Pandemic has disrupted many industries Globally in particular aviation, tourism, hospitality, F&B and other services where large % of locals are employed. Singapore is even more impacted on these sectors as we have no domestic market or domestic tourism unlike China, India, and the US. China’s domestic tourism is now at the pre-pandemic level. So are India and the US.   2/ Global and Regional companies set up operations in Singapore not to serve Singapore market which is tiny for them but to serve the region and the world. Singaporeans who are plugged into their regional and Global aspirations will do well and have been doing well. This means developing leadership qualities and new skills to serve external market. Singaporeans should focus on this as this the vital gap that exists. Top quality education as it exists in Singapore that does not prepare Singaporeans well for complexity and Chaos, but it provides theoretical expertise and knowledge. Rising in the corporate world requires ability to navigate the region and if it means working outside of Singapore for a while. The quality to understand complexity and chaos come naturally to those who come from bigger markets – US, Europe, India, China, Philippines, etc. Point is we should serve the region in our employment role and not get stuck in serving small markets if one must rise and progress.  3/ Pandemic has accelerated digitalization exponentially. And the skills required are very different and the demand is very high. Singapore Universities and Polys, though rated very well, cannot meet the demand. We can increase by 20% but it is still not enough. Singapore cannot afford to restrict talents in this IT and other engineering sectors. If we do, companies will move out and IT jobs can be done from anywhere now. Even in India, there is tremendous shortage of IT talents, and you have to Google to see the offers IT graduates are getting. First choice of Indian IT talent is US, Canada, and Europe not Singapore. We must fight hard to get these talents. Talk to IT companies and you will know. That is why we have so many unfilled IT positions.   4/ Can we substantially increase student intakes and train in IT from very early days? Yes, but it is not going to help meet the demand. Writing code is not a rising career and learning them will not help as a person can get stuck. But Exposure early stages will help to appreciate, and that knowledge will help. Most important is to realize that we don’t have adequate population base to keep supplying to meet the demand. Not all students have aptitude for engineering and Information technology. We cannot force. This is where India has an advantage. Millions study IT every year and discount the schools that are not good enough, but India will still produce few hundred thousand IT engineers every year. And close to 170K go to US every year as the demand is very high for this talent in the US and other countries in the West. Stop whining and accept the realities. The reality could be to shut the door to IT industries and the companies who need IT talents, but we will all suffer. We will lose regional investment and dislocation of those who are already here. Always remember Global and regional companies are not in Singapore to serve local market but to serve the region.  5/ Xenophobia and racism are mental disease. You can’t get agitated by seeing expats (Indians) and assume that they are all through CECA. Indians have been in senior position in Global and Regional companies for a very long period. Not all are in IT industries. Many are in leadership positions and brough here by their companies who have made huge investment. Around 20 Global CEO of tech companies and non-tech companies are Indians born and bred in India.   6/ Singaporeans must shed this parochial outlook and start behaving like a Global Citizen. We have the education and qualities, but xenophobia and racism will pull us back. We learn to embrace diversity and enjoy working with multiple cultures. Joy and learning are different.   Needless to highlight that we should have stricter policies, guidelines, and rules to weed out abuses that impact Singaporeans. But that is work in progress as the minister says. Understand the macro picture and let’s work out micro actions required. Let’s not push the country backward and collectively lower our living standards. ",2,en

"Dear friends.  For a leader to present or deal with a situation being debated in Parliament in a vague  way, especially trying to conceal the truth with an intent to mislead those seeking correct answers isn't what well-established Parliaments would appreciate. A learned and fair Speaker will order the  person concerned to either come to the point or step aside for others to speak.  I also heard leaders speaking on racial quotas, enclaves, etc. Like many of you, I too raised my white flag. What's happening to our elected leaders?  This particular issue concern CECA and the answers being sought is how CECA and $61 billion hadhelped Singaporeans.  Leaders must come out with facts and figures which are surely available with the Ministries concerned, not beat around the bush. Parliament isn't a venue for kids to play masak masak.  The same with issues on race, racial quotas, etc...  What's needed are real answers. Btw.... are race quotas in private condos also included like what HDB  dwellers are expected to adhere to? What about rental of HDB rooms to foreigners? Leaders, please answer all this questions and ask yourselves, ""Is racial quota in HDB estates working""?",64,en

Obviously, CECA is no good for Singaporeans otherwise believed me, PAP leaders will be the first ones to jump out and boast about it to claim credit.   Why are they still defending CECA when they knew to the core that CECA I’d not beneficial to Singapore.   They should have the courage to stand out, abolish it to prevent further harm to Singapore.  Making a mistake is one thing but knowing that this is a mistake and not correcting it, is another thing. I think the latter is a greater sin.  Ong Ye Kung claimed that Singapore investments in India had increased tremendously from 1.3 billion in 2005 to 61 billion in 2019. The picture painted looked rosy but did he mention, out of the 61 billon, how much constituted failed investments.   I remembered vividly that just in 2020, Temasek Holdings had lost at least 1 billion of public funds when the new state government overturned a contract to build an Indian state. I remembered in another case, SingTel was ordered by the Indian court to pay at least a few hundred million in compensation.   These are the failed investments that were published in the papers. I wonder how many similar investments which were not published in the papers. This could be just a tip of the iceberg 😀.  And OYK proudly claimed in parliament that 600+ Singapore companies had invested in India under CECA. But he did not mention how many Singaporeans get to work in those companies. Most likely the people employed are Indian nationals which are cheaper. This is what I called by own Singapore companies discriminating against own Singaporeans.   But for those Indian companies investing in Singapore, it is different. They get their own Indian nationals to work in those companies under the sinister intra-transfer under CECA.   Hence, I really dun know how has the ordinary Singaporeans benefited from CECA.   Maybe if the PAP government wanted Singaporeans to trust them that CECA had benefited the ordinary Singaporeans, then they should provide detailed information on employment under CECA both in India and Singapore segregated by Singaporean, PR and foreigners.",4,en

"I just listened to OYK's speech.  I agree with Lim Tean that it is a great generalization and making motherhood statement.  The key to any agreement is the execution.  Nothing is the works suggest that Singaporean has benefited from CECA and FTA.  Indeed with such a high concentration of such India Indians in place like CBP and Marina, there is every tendency to protect their own kind and build that village by bringing more of their kind, one excuse or the next.  Our MOM is too far from the ground to realize it until it is too late, like now.  Surely many Singapore's feel the same way and I [and we] were not influenced by people like the PSP.  Link this to the HDB policy of having a mixture of races in certain precinct and using GRC as an excuse.  That HDB policy was to prevent the congregation of any one race, and the citizen/race ratio was possibly used.  What about such a high concentration of India Indians now.  Look at some of the housing estate that are also concentration of such nationals.  It proves that they congregate and look after their own kind.

"In 2001 when i was a fresh graduate in computer IT, i got recruited as a programmer into a team of 4 other indians, myself the only singaporean, to a MNC Bank, total 5 of us. The only reason i got the job is to fulfil the singaporean quota. Team Lead Indian is a PR, He delegates the big project to 4 of us. I interacted and chit chatted with the 3 indian professionals trying to learn from them, the most senior programmer said he has 7 years programming experience in the programming language, 2nd senior said 5 years, 3rd indian said 2yrs. myself 2yrs from internship. After 3/4 weeks of meetings and understanding each other from warm-up programmings of small modules of the mega banking project, my opinion is that my skills from 2yrs experience is pretty much on-par with the most senior programmer of claimed 7yrs experience. The 2nd senior indian programmer of 5 yrs experience on resume is in his early 40s is a friendly guy and he told me frankly that i'm better than him in programming, and this conclusion was agreed by another senior filipino programmer. THe senior filipino is a experienced programmer outside the new mega project but he tell me frankly that the Team Lead Indian PR won't be counting on the 3rd indian programmer as it appears he don't know the programming language and still learning it after 3/4 weeks, despite the 2yr experience stated on his resume. The 8 months of programming mega project in this bank really opened up my horizons on the definition of ""talents"". How a ""talent"" is measured up depends on the ""senior talent"", quite similar to a father assigning work to his son. Will a father kick a son out of his team when he realized he don't have the skillsets for the job or will he keep quiet and give him all the time to learn and not expose him?

All they just need to do is to invest $2.5 millions in Singapore through CECA,  move their businesses and families over for two years to become citizens eligible for voting rights and enjoy the cheaper HDB housing, CPF savings, get protected by own family-business and enjoy the Govt hand outs once a while given to Singaporeans. The Govt is seeing increasing votes for opposition every year. The leaders are all in govt related business. Opposition is fighting to repel the racial ratio restriction in HDB estates and this might just be too good for Govt to ""move"" the new citizens into opposition strong hold! Right now they can only put them in the condos in the East - already they are taking over the management committees from Singaporeans. The signs of mess new citizens are there!

Clearly this agreement gives the Indians the upper hand in most transactions. Give figures if you are so sure and don't bring Xenophobia into the picture it has nothing to do with this CECA Agreement.  No South East Asian Country has signed such a lopsided agreement like this and I stand corrected on this.  It's sad when you see our young  even with proper education cant seem to get being employed on a permanent basis.

"We must first understand that who started and lobbied for CECA. It's dated and FTAs needs to be relevant to today's context. If we are still stuck in all theses dated policies lobbied 15years back by then Minister Tharman (correct me if am wrong), we are in a pathetic state. Our education system had fail us, policies had became so rigid that we couldn't change, whether because 4Gs are handcuffed to carry out orders or they lack critical thinking simply using the same playbook, and hope to get a different result. Our ministers are so highly paid and its becoming very comfortable to just not rock the boat and simply wait out for another musical chairs of ""cabinet reshuffle"". I would love to see 4Gs step up and start championing break through policies and dare to dismantle existing without fear of removing dino policies set by Dino politicians for the sake of preserving their legacy. This won't work for us and this is not a mindset of a leader who cares. These are a mark of puppets. Not to forget and be reminded our govt, they work for us, we the people, if they have no guts or ability to change things, they had fail what our founding father LKY had built. The future belongs to leaders who cares and dare to change things despite fearing offense of higher powers because they know it is good for the people. Remember our late LKY that we so respect, how he built Singapore, he had a different mindset that we so need today. He dares to change and rock the boat. We need leaders that dares to take down dated policies and start working for us, not going around the bush and get nothing done and treat this as a ""discussion"". This is meaningless and a waste of time. I would love to see opposition parties step up in times like this to shine. Go in prepared, show us substance and think for us fellow Singaporeans. We need leaders who cares to represent us more than ever and guided by conscience. I seen many things these days that our govt failed to protect us. It is time for all of us to unite and craft a new chapter after covid. Can't let our great nation spiral down. Thanks Lim tean for sharing and standing up.

Ur strategy from day 1 is to “create doubt” about those u dislike, so that even if can’t prove them wrong, the doubt alone is good fodder for u to spread misinformation to the lunatics who support u. That’s a typical strategy “lawyers” or “liars” use btw. Where is ur credible data? Fight data with data and stop playing this game of exploiting the stupidity and ignorance of the dumbasses that use jobs as a smokescreen for their real hidden agenda. Where is ur proof? U notice no one asked u for statistics to back up what u say, but all jumping on bandwagon to hear the shit u say? And the fact U didn’t analyse other FTAs is very glaringly and unsurprising. Why? Simple. U need to find hot button issues to exploit the the same dumbasses that support u so that u can play up their emotions. That’s why worker’s party way ahead of ur clown party. Even leader of opposition and other opposition parties also agreed CECA does benefit but they also cannot completely lose face and admit directly but they did so indirectly, (read Pritam Singh’s response) and they cant back down completely, then it’s a total defeat, so now they must exploit where the foreign workers come from as the next new issue, since proving CECA doesn’t benefit sg didn’t work. Let me guess, Whites okay, China okay (double okay), Malaysians okay, Filipinos okay, but Indian nationals not okay? How many white collared jobs in hands of whites? But must suck their dicks and lick balls to welcome them and no one saying Holland village looks less singaporean or Raffles City looks less singaporean. If u look at the thread of comments online, u can tell majority comes from which group of singaporeans. So must pick on Indian nationals. Don’t wanna be helper, construction worker, cleaner, packer, but no shame to let others do it. Such an arrogant fucked up society sg is becoming. Those jobs no big deal ya, u didn’t debate in parliament. Why? Again simple, not a hot button issue which can be manipulated. Job is a job right? But no…. Must only exploit the PMET issue. How many local IT graduates u know jobless due to CECA and not other reasons? Where is your data? How many degree holders to handle banking & finance and the new digital economy that u know of lost jobs due to CECA? Where is your data? Prove its due to CECA and not other factors. The reality is singaporeans don’t have the experience or qualifications or either, or not keen or the field of study too narrow. It could be a combination of these factors too but no, u deliberately harp on CECA coz as I said, u won’t dare expose the reality otherwise u have nothing to exploit the unhappiness of the people and so much false pride in sg for the lunatics that if u speak the truth, u will lose support coz that’s not wat they wanna hear. There are so many others working hard to earn a living, foreign or local, u don’t see them coming online to fan the flames of hatred coz they are not struggling for attention m. They have made a living. Where is your data? Government gave data but u can’t fight back and it’s the PAP who threw down the gauntlet and asked opposition parties to file a motion to debate CECA.

The market dynamics shifted very fast with new technologies and can Singaporeans easily switch and adept to the needs of the society. I hardly think so, and this is the outcome.",1,en

I have about 15yrs IT experience, though mostly in sales/biz dev... when I send out hundreds of job applications for a junior IT exec/mgr roles, i get 0 response. yes ZERO. when I get a respond from recruiter it will be for a different industry or role... I don't even get an interview... so what shortage i really cannot see... I only know many local fresh grads also no jobs... locals are encouraged to even study to become a Hawker or PHV driver... sg had more than 20yrs to so-call groom local IT talents and yet till now we still need to rely so heavily on ceca trash???",1,en

FT issue had been brought up on 2011 GE. After the decade the PAP still cannot resolve and secure jobs for Singaporean. Whatever policy PAP implemented doesn't work well since many years back. Company still hiring FT and MoM still approved the EP based on the ration quota. This is ridiculous. We must continue to vote opposition to bring more voices in the parliament. I hope the next GE the opposition will win more seats than ever,0,en
